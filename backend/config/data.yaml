            <p>The 1st and 2nd defendants, a married couple, became the registered joint owners of
                a Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flat in 1984 after an alleged arrangement was made with
                the 1st defendant’s brother (the 1st plaintiff) and mother, now deceased, (the 3rd
                defendant) whereby the mother would pay the deposit and the initial expenses; the
                balance would be financed by a mortgage to be paid by family members occupying the
                flat and those contributing to the purchase price would have pro tanto beneficial
                interest in the flat. As administrator of his mother’s estate,  the 1st plaintiff
                was also the 3rd plaintiff and his wife was the 2nd plaintiff. The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs
                had also paid some mortgage instalments when residing in the flat from 1987-1991.
                In 1997, the 1st and 2nd defendants agreed to sell the flat to the 3rd defendant.
                The plaintiffs contended they were the beneficial owners of the flat and the 1st and
                2nd defendants held the flat as their trustees. As a preliminary issue, the court
                was asked to decide whether the arrangement as pleaded was void under  s 17B of the
                Housing Ordinance , as an agreement to alienate the beneficial interest in the flat.
                Further, it had to decide whether the plaintiffs’ payments made with the intention
                of acquiring the beneficial interest in the flat were also void. The Court of First
                Instance (see   [2007] HKCU 2029) held that there was no alienation as there was no
                positive act by the defendants. The 2nd defendant appealed.
            </p>
            <h2>Held</h2>
            <p><b>Held, allowing the appeal:</b></p>
            <p>(1)	The lower court overlooked the positive acts by the defendants: first, by making
                the arrangement; secondly, by using the money provided by the mother to pay the deposit
                and the initial expenses; and, thirdly, by permitting the plaintiffs to reside in
                the flat and make instalment payments (para 26).      (2)	The use of the word ‘alienation’
                in s 17B must have been intended to cover something other than the sale of the flat
                or grant of a tenancy or exclusive licence. That ‘something’ must have related to
                the creation and grant of rights over the flat, which did not involve either its sale
                or the grant of a tenancy or exclusive licence in respect of it, but which impinged
                upon the most important features of ownership. In this case, the 1st and 2nd defendant’s
                participation in and the carrying out of the arrangement resulted in the 'creation
                and grant of rights over the flat' in favour of the plaintiffs.  Re a Solicitor [2000]
                HKCU 1003, (CACV 117/2000, Court of Appeal, 8 December 2000, unreported)  applied
                (paras 27-28). (3)	The fact that the arrangement was made amongst family members did
                not make any difference.  It may be that some families had to and did pool their resources.
                If the arrangement was meant to be binding in honour only, the court could see no
                difficulty.  There would have been no alienation.  But if family members entered into
                a legally binding arrangement, they should not be treated differently from friends
                or strangers (para 31). Instrument of fraud (4)	The principle that a statute designed
                to prevent fraud should not be allowed to be used as an instrument of fraud had no
                application here.  The objects/purposes of s 17B and the other legislation under consideration
                were very different.  The purpose of s 17B was not to prevent fraudulent claims to
                an interest in land.  The purpose of s 17B was to ensure that HOS flats should go
                to qualified persons in accordance with the HOS rules.  HOS flats were subsidised
                and they were not meant to be traded as if they were outside the HOS. If the arrangement
                amounted to an alienation, it was difficult to see how the court could disapply s
                17B.  Rochefoucauld  v Boustead  [1897] 1 Ch 196,  Bannister v Bannister  [1948] 2

            <h2>Judgment</h2>
            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
            <p id="1">This appeal concerns a property at Flat No 1, Second Floor, Block F of Lok Nga Court,
                No 50 Chun Wah Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong (the flat), which was part of a Home Ownership
                Scheme (HOS). 
            </p>
            <p id="2">By a sale and purchase agreement dated 17 November 1983 and an assignment dated 20
                February 1984 made with the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA), the 1st and 2nd defendants,
                a husband and wife, became the registered joint owners of the flat. The purchase price
                was $222,500. The 1st defendant passed away in August 2007. The 2nd defendant, who
                is on legal aid, has been represented by Miss Lisa Wong, SC throughout. 
            </p>
            <p id="3">The 1st plaintiff was the brother of the 1st defendant. The 1st plaintiff, as the
                administrator of the estate of his mother Wong King Shui (or Sui), deceased (the mother),
                who died on 14 September 1991, is also the 3rd plaintiff. The 2nd plaintiff is the
                1st plaintiff’s wife. The 1st plaintiff has been served with a notice of proceedings
                but has not taken any part in the proceedings. The 2nd plaintiff appeared in person.
            </p>
            <p id="4">The 3rd defendant is the purchaser under a Chinese Provisional Agreement for Sale
                and Purchase of the flat from the 1st and 2nd defendants. By a provisional agreement
                dated 23 January 1997 (the Provisional Agreement), the 1st and 2nd defendants agreed
                to sell the flat to the 3rd defendant for $1.2 million. This has become the subject
                of third party proceedings with which we are not presently concerned.
            </p>
            <p id="5">The present claim was commenced by the plaintiffs against the defendants on 27 April
                1999. The plaintiffs claimed that they, personally, and the 1st plaintiff as the administrator
                of the mother’s estate, are the beneficial owners of the flat and that the 1st and
                2nd defendants held the flat as their trustees. The plaintiffs’ case is that in or
                about 1983, the mother wanted to purchase a HOS flat for use as a residence of members
                of the family. As a result, the family members, including the mother, the 1st plaintiff
                and the 1st defendant, entered into an arrangement that was pleaded in paragraph 5(b)
                of the Statement of Claim (the Arrangement).
            </p>
            <p id="6">The Arrangement was that:</p>
            <p id="7">Pursuant to the Arrangement, two applications were made to the HKHA, one in the mother’s
                name and the other in the joint name of the 1st and 2nd defendants. The 1st and 2nd
                defendants’ application was successful, resulting in the purchase of the flat.
            </p>
            <p id="8">It is common ground that the deposit and the initial expenses for the purchase of
                the flat were provided by the mother. The balance of the purchase price in the sum
                of $200,000 was financed by a mortgage in favour of Sin Hua Trust, Savings and Commercial
                Bank Limited, which was repayable by monthly instalments over 15 years. The whole
                of the mortgage loan was paid off in about April 1999.
            </p>
            <p id="9">The defendants denied the existence of the Arrangement, although they admitted that
                the mother had paid the deposit as well as the expenses for the purchase of the flat.
                They claimed the payments were gifts from the mother to them. They also admitted that
                the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs had paid some of the mortgage instalments when they were
                residing in the flat, but they said they were fees or payments for use and occupation
                of the flat. They also claimed that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs occupied the flat pursuant
                to a licence in early 1987, which was revoked in late 1991 or early 1992.
            </p>
            <p id="10">More importantly, for the present purpose, the 2nd defendant contended that even if
                there was indeed the Arrangement, the Arrangement amounted to an agreement to alienate
                and an alienation of beneficial interest in the flat, contrary to  s 17B(1) of the
                Housing Ordinance , and is void.
            </p>
            <p id="11"> s 17B of the  Housing Ordinance  at the time of the sale and purchase agreement in
                1983 provided:
            </p>
            <p>The current version of s 17B is of similar effect.</p>
            <p id="12">By an order of 16 February 2007, Deputy Judge Gill ordered that the following questions
                or issues be tried as preliminary issues before the trial of the other questions or
                issues in this action:
            </p>
            <p id="13">These preliminary issues were heard by Chu J who held that:</p>
            <p><b>The Appeal</b></p>
            <p id="14">This is the 2nd defendant’s appeal.</p>
            <p id="15">The matter first came before us on 23 January 2009 when we were told by Madam Lam,
                the 2nd plaintiff, that her appeal against refusal of legal aid was heard on 16 December
                2008, but she was still awaiting the result. Because of the important legal issues
                involved, we adjourned the hearing and told the parties that if legal aid was refused,
                Madam Lam should try the Bar Free Legal Service Scheme; failing both, the court would
                appoint an amicus curiae.
            </p>
            <p id="16">By letter dated 9 April 2009, Messrs Chong, So &amp; Co, solicitors for the 2nd defendant,
                informed the court that Madam Lam’s application for legal aid had been refused, however
                because Madam Lam was busy, she had not approached the Bar Free Legal Service Scheme.
            </p>
            <p id="17">By a letter dated 27 April 2009, the court informed Madam Lam that she should try
                the Bar Free Legal Service Scheme.
            </p>
            <p id="18">By letter dated 30 October 2009, Messrs Chong, So &amp; Co informed the court that Madam
                Lam had informed them that because she was busy, she had neither the time nor the
                inclination to seek help from the Bar Free Legal Service Scheme.
            </p>
            <p id="19">In November 2009, Mr Anderson Chow, SC, was instructed as amicus curiae. The matter
                returned to us for hearing on 7 September 2010. The 2nd plaintiff has not made any
                submission, and we would have had considerable difficulty but for Mr Chow’s assistance,
                for which we are grateful.
            </p>
            <p><b>Alienation</b></p>
            <p id="20">It is obvious that the critical question is, whether the Arrangement amounted to an
                alienation, purported alienation, or agreement to alienate the flat (for brevity sake,
                I shall refer to them collectively as alienation except where the context requires
                differentiation between them). 
            </p>
            <p id="21">As Mr Chow pointed out the words or expressions "alienation" or "agreement to alienate"
                are not defined in the Ordinance. He has referred us to:
            </p>
            <p id="22">Mr Chow submitted that one gathers from the above, "alienation" or "agreement to alienate"
                generally involves the disposition or transfer of some right or interest in property
                by an owner to another person, or an agreement to do so. He submitted that a common
                characteristic is that they involve some positive act by the person making the alienation
                effecting a transfer or creation of some right of ownership of property. 
            </p>
            <p id="23">Mr Chow submitted that:</p>
            <p id="24">Chu J decided against the defendant because:</p>
            <p id="25">It is true that if a property is conveyed to A but B paid the purchase price in the
                character of a purchaser, a resulting trust will be presumed. But here, as Chu J has
                correctly pointed out, there is no need to resort to a resulting trust, because the
                actual intention of the parties could be gathered from the Arrangement. Chu J went
                on to say that the plaintiffs’ claim against the 1st and 2nd defendants fell to be
                considered under the concept of common intention constructive trust, and that the
                beneficial interest under such a trust arises from the date of the detrimental conduct
                of the claimant: Underhill and Hayton, Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees, 17th Ed,
                p 528. However, it was critical to Chu J’s decision that there was no positive act
                by the 1st and 2nd defendants.
            </p>
            <p id="26">With respect, Chu J has overlooked the positive acts by the 1st and 2nd defendants.
                Firstly, by making the Arrangement; secondly, by using the money provided by the mother
                to pay the deposit and the initial expenses; and, thirdly, by permitting the plaintiffs
                to reside in the flat and make installment payments. The fact that the Arrangement
                or the payments resulted in beneficial interests in the flat being vested in the plaintiffs
                or the mother by operation of the law does not mean that they were not the consequence
                of the 1st and 2nd defendants’ action. 
            </p>
            <p id="27">In  Re a Solicitor [2000] HKCU 1003, (CACV 117/2000, Court of Appeal, 8 December 2000,
                unreported), Keith JA, in giving the judgment of the court said at para 14:
            </p>
            <p id="28">Re a Solicitor was concerned with disciplinary proceedings against a solicitor in
                which it was necessary for the court to decide whether the creation of an unauthorised
                legal charge amounted to an alienation of the property within the meaning of s 17B.
                However, Keith JA’s explanation is wide enough to cover the present situation, since
                it was the 1st and 2nd defendant’s participation in and the carrying out of the Arrangement
                which resulted in the "creation and grant of rights over the flat" in favour of the
                plaintiffs.
            </p>
            <p id="29">It is unfortunate that the matter had proceeded by means of preliminary issues. The
                consequence is that we have to take the facts as pleaded in para. 5 of the Statement
                of Claim. We have also to assume that in entering into the Arrangement, the members
                of the family had intended to enter into legal relations. The issue is whether in
                the circumstances there has been an alienation by the 1st and 2nd defendants of any
                interest in the flat. Mr Chow accepted that if the 1st and 2nd defendants had entered
                into a similar arrangement subsequent to the sale and purchase agreement or the assignment,
                for example, in return for payment of the purchase price or part of it they would
                hold all or part of the beneficial interest in the flat for the payer, such an arrangement
                would have amounted to an alienation within the meaning of s 17B. Also, if the 1st
                and 2nd defendants had, after they had acquired the flat, agreed to charge it to their
                mother in return for a loan, that would be covered by the decision in Re a Solicitor
                and is void. 
            </p>
            <p id="30">Suppose, an applicant for a HOS flat, who, after learning that his application was
                successful, agrees to sell his "right" to a third party who would then make all necessary
                payments. Could it be said that because by operation of law the applicant would hold
                the beneficial interest in the flat upon signing of the sale and purchase agreement
                upon trust for the third party, there was no alienation within the meaning of s 17B,
                because the successful applicant never had any beneficial interest to "alienate"?
                Suppose an intended applicant agrees with another person that he would apply for a
                HOS flat which he would hold for the other person, and his application was successful,
                and the other person then makes all the payments. Can it be said that there has been
                no alienation, purported alienation or agreement to alienate within the meaning of
                s 17B? We think not.
            </p>
            <p id="31">Nor do we think the fact that the Arrangement was made amongst family members makes
                any difference. It may be that, as Chu J had remarked, some families have to and do
                pool their resources. If the arrangement was meant to be binding in honour only, we
                can see no difficulty. There would have been no alienation. But if family members
                entered into a legally binding arrangement, they should not be treated differently
                from friends or strangers. 
            </p>
            <p id="32">Mr Chow submitted that it is not possible on the material before us to decide how
                much of the beneficial interest in the flat could be said to have been acquired by
                the mother. From the pleaded arrangement it seems clear that it was not the plaintiffs’
                case that by contributing the entirety of the 10% deposit and the initial expenses,
                the mother had acquired the entire beneficial interests in the flat. Rather it was
                the plaintiffs’ case that the beneficial interest in the flat was acquired piecemeal,
                first 10% and such further percentage as represented by the initial expenses by the
                mother and then subsequently by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs, whenever they made a mortgage
                payment. 
            </p>
            <p id="33">On such basis, Mr Chow sought to rely on the tentative views expressed by Johnson
                Lam J in  Chan Chui Mee v Mak Chi Choi [2009] 1 HKLRD 343 [2008] HKCU 1449 where he
                said at 356 in para 40:
            </p>
            <p id="34">The context for the above statements was:</p>
            <p id="35">With respect, the tentative views of Lam J have no bearing on the meaning to be attributed
                to alienation under s 17B.
            </p>
            <p id="36">Mr Chow also submitted that since alienation covered by s 17B is a crime under section
                27A, the court should read the expression restrictively and be careful not to give
                a meaning to alienation which an ordinary person would not recognise. With respect,
                we believe there is no danger of that with our approach.
            </p>
            <p><b>Instrument of Fraud</b></p>
            <p id="37">Mr Chow submitted that if the Arrangement is held to be void, s 17B would be used
                as an instrument of fraud.
            </p>
            <p id="38">The principle that a statute which was designed to prevent fraud should not be allowed
                to be used as an instrument of fraud is normally stated and applied in the context
                of the statutory requirement of writing under  ss 40 and 53 of the  Law of Property
                Act 1925  (and the former Statute of Frauds), see Snell's Equity, 31st Ed, paras 15-09
                and 20-14.
            </p>
            <p id="39">In the leading case of  Rochefoucauld v Boustead  [1897] 1 Ch 196, a property was
                purchased by the defendant which the court found to have been on the basis as trustee
                for the plaintiff. The defendant resisted the plaintiff s claim on the ground of,
                inter alia, absence of writing. This defence was rejected. Lindley LJ, giving the
                judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated at p 206 as follows:
            </p>
            <p id="40">In  Bannister v Bannister  [1948] 2 All ER 133 at 136, Scott LJ stated the principle
                more generally:
            </p>
            <p id="41">Mr Chow relied on the fact that the same principle has been applied to statutes which
                were not designed to prevent fraud such as  s 34(4) of the  Land Registration Act
                1925  which would enable a transferee of the registered title to take free from any
                encumbrance which had not been registered. In  Lyus and Anor v Prowsa Developments
                Ltd.   [1982] 1 WLR 1044 Dillon J said at p 1054:
            </p>
            <p id="42">We do not believe this principle can have application here. The objects/purposes of
                s 17B and the other legislation under consideration are very different. The purpose
                of s 17B is not to prevent fraudulent claims to an interest in land. The purpose of
                s 17B is to ensure that HOS flats should go to qualified persons in accordance with
                the HOS rules. HOS flats are subsidised and they are not meant to be traded as if
                they were outside the HOS. The strong measures introduced by s 17B and section 27A
                to prevent unlawful alienation is to us, compelling reason to reject Mr Chow’s submission.
            </p>
            <p id="43">With respect, if the Arrangement amounted to an alienation, we find it difficult to
                see how the court could disapply s 17B. Mr Chow did not contend that s 17B could be
                disapplied if we are concerned with an outright sale. Why is s 17B an engine of fraud,
                if one should be permitted to deny a secret trust, or a constructive trust, but not
                if it is an outright sale? When the legislature has seen fit to render an alienation
                void, we do not believe the court can ignore it. Mr Chow submitted that here the prohibition
                is not absolute, alienation could take place, e.g. with permission or after a certain
                time. That may be so, but it is sufficient for our propose that otherwise the prohibition
                is absolute.
            </p>
            <p id="44">For the above reasons, we would answer the issues as follows:</p>
            <p id="45">It follows that we would allow the appeal with costs against the 2nd plaintiff. The
                costs are to be taxed in accordance with the   Legal Aid Regulations .

            <p>Shatin New Town (the development) was developed by four developers in 1983. The applicant
                was the owners’ corporation. The development included a commercial portion which was
                made up of four levels and a basement which consisted of shops and car parks. On top
                of the commercial portion were eight high-rise blocks of 1,400 residential units (the
                residential blocks).
            </p>
            <p>At a meeting of the owners, a resolution was passed to carry out maintenance works
                to the lobbies, entrance halls and exterior walls of the residential blocks (the area).
                It was also resolved that the monthly management fees of the residential units would
                be increased for the purpose of carrying out the works by $450 per month for a period
                of 24 months from 1 December 2005 to November 2007. The total amount to be contributed
                for the maintenance works was $15,120,000.
            </p>
            <p>The respondent was the owner of one of the residential units. He paid the increased
                management fees from December 2005 to March 2006, but refused to do so from April
                2006 onwards. The amount unpaid up to November 2007 was $9,000.
            </p>
            <p>The applicant sued the respondent for the recovery of $9,000. The case was tried in
                the Lands Tribunal by HH Judge Wong who dismissed the application (see   [2009] HKCU
                188). The applicant now appealed.
            </p>
            <p>The issue raised in this appeal was whether the entrances and exterior walls of the
                residential parts of a mixed commercial/residential development were within the exclusive
                possession of the original developers, who therefore should be solely responsible
                for their maintenance, or whether these areas were common parts of the development
                whose expenses in maintenance should be shared by contribution from the owners of
                the residential units; and if so, how their contribution should be calculated.
            </p>
            <h2>Held</h2>
            <p><b>Held, allowing the appeal with a provisional costs order of the costs of the appeal
                    and below:</b></p>
            <p>(1) When someone owned a flat or unit in a multi-unit development in Hong Kong, it
                meant in legal terms that he held a notional share (the amount of which was specified
                in the original assignment from the vendor to him or in the Deed of Mutual Covenant
                (DMC)) in the development as tenants in common with the other owners of the development
                but he was given ‘exclusive possession’ of his own flat to the exclusion of the other
                co-owners. In contrast to this specific unit, the common parts of the development
                such as entrance, passageways, garden, utility rooms and exterior walls were not within
                the exclusive possession of any of the owners but were to be used and enjoyed by all
                of them. The ambit of the common parts of the development was usually specified in
                the DMC. If not, the   Building Management Ordinance (BMO) (Cap 344)  would apply
                and define the common parts (para 1).
            </p>
            <p>(2) The common area as described in the First Schedule of the DMC (which had 7/83186th
                shares (the seven shares)) was not within the exclusive possession of the developers
                as the co-owners had the full right and liberty under Clause A1 of Section II of the
                DMC, to go, pass and repass over and along and use such of the entrance halls, lobbies,
                staircases, landing, passages, lifts and other common areas as formed part of the
                residential blocks (paras 8–12).
            </p>
            <p>(3) The rights conferred upon the developers in Clause 7 of Section I of the DMC,
                inter alia, to erect pipes on the exterior walls, and also to use the exterior walls
                for advertising purposes were qualified. First, the developer required prior approval
                of the manager of the development before they could exercise these rights. Secondly,
                there were two further conditions applied in respect of the advertising right, ie
                the approval of government authorities, and that the exercise of the rights must not
                unnecessarily interrupt the enjoyment of the residential units (paras 14–16).
            </p>
            <p>(4) Since the relevant clauses in the DMC did not confer exclusive possession of the
                area to the developers,  s 34H of the  BMO , which mandated that an owner who had
                exclusive possession to a part of the building, shall maintain that part in good repair
                and condition, was not applicable. The maintenance expenses had to be shared by the
                residential owners of the area (paras 20–22).
            </p>
            <p>(5) The BMO had identified three types of funds, namely, general, contingency and
                special. Based on the events that had happened, the applicant did appear to have established
                a special fund to provide for the maintenance work. The expenditure to the maintenance
                work was ‘a kind not expected by the manager to be incurred annually’. Unlike  s 22(2)
                of the  BMO  which provided that the amount shall be fixed by the management committee
                in accordance with the respective shares of the owners, there was no provision in
                s 4 of the Seventh Schedule of the  BMO  that in default of provisions of the DMC
                on the method of computation, the ‘share rate’ would apply (paras 31–32).
            </p>
            <p>(6) The computation in the 5th Column of the Second Schedule of the DMC according
                to ‘share rate’ was not applicable because it did not refer to further contribution
                of management expenses relating to the common parts and common facilities of the residential
                buildings (paras 37, 43).
            </p>
            <p>(7) The ‘flat rate’ method adopted by the applicant was correct in accordance with
                the 3rd Column of the Second Schedule of the DMC. The expenses relating to the maintenance
                of the area come within the meaning of ‘management expenses under cl 1 of ss D of
                section V of the DMC which shall be paid by the owners of the residential blocks (not
                commercial blocks) under cl 2 of ss D of section V of the DMC since the maintenance
                work was solely for the benefit of the residential owners (paras 44, 46, 47, 49).
            </p>
            <p><b>Obiter</b></p>
            <p>(8) In many of the Lands Tribunal cases, proceedings were brought or resisted on disputes
                wherein the monetary value was extremely small, but the costs of the proceedings far
                exceeded the value of the claim. In this claim, the difference in value of the various
                methods of calculation was extremely small. Very often, an owner who had lost his
                case would eventually lose his property because the property was charged and disposed
                of by the successful party in order to satisfy the costs’ order. Very often, such
                property was the unsuccessful owner’s only asset of substance. The solicitors advising
                owners in such disputes were duty bound to spell out clearly to them, before instituting
                or contesting the proceedings, the costs’ implications and to give a realistic estimate
                of the likely costs to be incurred both in respect of the owner’s own costs and the
                opponent’s costs, together with a warning of the possible consequence of losing one’s
                flat in the event of losing his case (para 51).
            </p>
            <h2>Judgment</h2>
            <p><b>Ownership of multi-unit development</b></p>
            <p id="1">When someone owns a flat or unit in a multi-unit development in Hong Kong, it means
                in legal terms that he holds a notional share (the amount of which is specified in
                the original assignment from the vendor to him or in the Deed of Mutual Covenant (DMC))
                in the development as tenants in common with the other owners of the development but
                he is given ‘exclusive possession’ of his own flat to the exclusion of the other co-owners.
                In contrast to this specific unit, the common parts of the development such as entrance,
                passageways, garden, utility rooms and exterior walls are not within the exclusive
                possession of any of the owners but are to be used and enjoyed by all of them. The
                ambit of the common parts of the development is usually specified in the DMC. If not,
                the   Building Management Ordinance (BMO) (Cap 344)  will apply and defines the common
                parts.
            </p>
            <p id="2">The issue raised in this appeal is whether the entrances and exterior walls of the
                residential parts of a mixed commercial/residential development are within the exclusive
                possession of the original developers, who therefore should be solely responsible
                for their maintenance, or whether these areas are common parts of the development
                whose expenses in maintenance should be shared by contribution from the owners of
                the residential units.
            </p>
            <p><b>The background</b></p>
            <p id="3">Shatin New Town (the development) was developed by four developers in 1983. The applicant
                is the owners’ corporation. The development is comprised of a commercial portion which
                is made up of four levels and a basement. The commercial portion consists of shops
                and car parks. On top of the commercial portion are eight high-rise blocks of 1,400
                residential units (the residential blocks).
            </p>
            <p id="4">At a meeting of the owners held on 19 November 2005 a resolution was passed to carry
                out maintenance works to the lobbies, entrance halls and exterior walls of the residential
                blocks (the area). It was further resolved that the monthly management fees of the
                residential units would be increased for the purpose of carrying out the maintenance
                by $450 per month from the then monthly sum of $550 to $1,000, for a period of 24
                months from 1 December 2005 to November 2007. The total amount to be contributed for
                the maintenance is $15,120,000.
            </p>
            <p id="5">The respondent is the owner of one of the residential units. He paid the increased
                management fees from December 2005 to March 2006, but   refused to do so from April
                2006 onwards. The amount to be paid up to November 2007 was $9,000.
            </p>
            <p id="6">The applicant sued the respondent for the recovery of $9,000. The case was tried in
                the Lands Tribunal by H H Judge Wong who dismissed the application. The applicant
                now appeals.
            </p>
            <p><b>The Judge’s reasoning</b></p>
            <p id="7">The Judge rejected the applicant’s claim because he held that the area was ‘owned’
                by the developers and the maintenance thereof should be their sole responsibility
                and not that of the respondent.
            </p>
            <p><b>The seven shares</b></p>
            <p id="8">The Judge relied upon two clauses in the DMC in support of the ‘ownership’ point.
                First, a provision in the First Schedule of the DMC. In this Schedule, the respective
                shares of the residential units, shops, car parks and other areas as of the development
                are specified. The total shares are 83186. The description of the part which has 7/83186th
                shares (‘the seven shares’) is:
            </p>
            <p id="9">The Judge held that the part which I have underlined above, namely ‘all communal areas
                of the Estate and of each Block not hereinbefore mentioned’ covered the area, namely,
                the lobbies, entrance halls and exterior walls. No issue is taken by Ms Lisa Wong,
                SC, counsel for the applicant, that the area may come within the ambit of the description
                of the seven shares, but the real issue in this appeal is whether the area is within
                the exclusive possession of the developers. In my view it is not.
            </p>
            <p id="10">The area clearly is described by the DMC as the common areas of   the ‘Blocks’ meaning
                the eight residential buildings of the development.
            </p>
            <p id="11">The rights of the co-owners to use the common areas of the Blocks are spelt out by
                Clause A1 of Section II of the DMC:
            </p>
            <p id="12">The developers may well have reserved the area to themselves under the seven shares,
                but it does not mean that they have exclusive possession over it.
            </p>
            <p id="13">The consequence of any other interpretation would be unthinkable: it would mean that
                the owners of the 1,400 residential units would not have the right to use such essential
                facilities such as the entrance halls and lobbies, and could only do so at the whim
                and pleasure of the developers. One of the overriding objectives in the construction
                of a document such as the DMC is to give effect to that which a reasonable man (rather
                than a pedantic lawyer) would have understood the parties to mean. Therefore, if in
                spite of linguistic problems the meaning is clear, it is that meaning which must prevail:
                Jumbo King Ltd v Faithful Properties Ltd &amp; Ors [1999] 4 HKC 707 (1999) 2 HKCFAR 279
                per Litton PJ at 296.
            </p>
            <p><b>Clause 7</b></p>
            <p id="14">The second clause relied upon by the Judge is Clause 7 of Section I of the DMC which
                confers upon the developers:
            </p>
            <p id="15">The rights that are given to the developers are to erect pipes on the exterior walls,
                and also to use the exterior walls for advertising purposes. While these are described
                as exclusive rights, they are in fact qualified. First, the developers must have the
                prior approval of the manager of the development before they can exercise these rights.
                Second, in respect of the advertising right this is subject to two further conditions,
                namely, the approval of government authorities, and that the exercise of the rights
                must not unnecessarily interrupt the enjoyment of the residential units.
            </p>
            <p id="16">Considering that the exterior walls are specifically designated as a common area which
                is to be used by all the owners, the conferring of the so-called ‘exclusive right’
                of the exterior walls to the developers for some limited purpose does not in my view
                provide the developers with exclusive possession of the exterior walls.
            </p>
            <p id="17">In  Incorporated Owners of Goa Building v Wui Tat Co Ltd [2004] 1 HKC 348 [2004] CPR
                56, CACV 349/2002, this Court (Rogers VP, Le Pichon JA and Waung J) construed a similar,
                although not identical, clause in a DMC which gave the party the exclusive right to
                use the exterior walls for advertising and to install pipes. There are similar restrictions
                by way of prior approvals before such rights can be exercised.
            </p>
            <p id="18">This Court then held that such rights ‘did not comprise all the rights which would
                amount to the exclusive possession or the exclusive right to the use, occupation or
                enjoyment of a part of the building. The rights were merely part of the rights which
                might be enjoyed by an owner but were not the full and exclusive rights’.
            </p>
            <p id="19">Although admittedly the exact wording of the clause in Goa Building is different:
                ‘the external walls of the said Building and of any part of the Building in common
                use. . .’, nevertheless the construction nonetheless of its effect is equally clearly
                applicable to the present case.
            </p>
            <p><b>Section 34H</b></p>
            <p id="20">The Judge relied on  s 34H of the  BMO  to hold that the developers are responsible
                for the expenses relating to the maintenance of the area:
            </p>
            <p id="21">Once it can be seen that the relevant clauses in the DMC do not confer exclusive possession
                of the area to the developers, then s 34H,   which mandates that an owner who has
                exclusive possession to a part of the building to maintain it in good repair and condition
                in the absence of such an obligation in the DMC, is not applicable to the present
                case at all.
            </p>
            <p id="22">Mr. Lawrence Cheung, counsel for the respondent, has argued that the first part of
                s 34H should be read disjunctively, and that exclusive possession is not the only
                criterion for an owner to be responsible for the maintenance of that part of the building.
                My view is that even if that part of the section is to be read disjunctively, and
                the section is to encompass three situations, namely, nevertheless within the context
                of a multi unit development such as the present one, a person who owns any part of
                the building must be entitled to exclusive possession thereof, or have an exclusive
                right thereupon, before s 34H comes into play. In the present case the maintenance
                expenses have to be shared by the residential owners.
            </p>
            <p id="23">It is accepted by Ms Wong that the DMC was badly drafted. There is no apparent correlation
                between its many parts. There are, for example, matters referred to in the Schedules
                of the DMC which bear no relationship to the main body of the DMC. The reservation
                of the area to the developer when the parts therein are already defined as common
                areas is another example. But as Lord Hoffmann observed in  Investors Compensation
                Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896 at 913
            </p>
            <p><b>Computation</b></p>
            <p id="24">The Judge also held that if the respondent is required to contribute, then the contribution
                should be based on his share in the development i.e. 37/83186th, and not based upon
                a uniform rate applicable to all the 1,400 residential units (‘the flat rate’). The
                Judge chose the computation based   on shares by reference to  s 22(2) of the  BMO
                .
            </p>
            <p><b>General and contingency funds</b></p>
            <p id="25">Section 22(2) has to be read in conjunction with sections 20 and 21. Section 20 requires
                the corporation to set up two funds: a general fund and a contingency fund. The purpose
                of the general fund is:
            </p>
            <p id="26">The purpose of the contingency fund is:</p>
            <p id="27">Section 21(2) requires a management committee of the corporation to determine the
                amount to be contributed by the owners to the two funds.
            </p>
            <p><b>Section 22(2)</b></p>
            <p id="28">Section 22(2) then provides that,</p>
            <p id="29">The difficulty with the Judge’s reliance upon s 22(2) is that he did not find that
                the maintenance of the area come within the ambit of either of these two funds. Instead
                he referred to the ‘special fund’ identified by  s 4 of the 7th Schedule of the  BMO
                .
            </p>
            <p><b>The special fund</b></p>
            <p id="30">The relevant parts of s 4 are as follows:</p>
            <p id="31">One can see that the BMO has identified three types of funds, namely, general, contingency
                and special.
            </p>
            <p id="32">Based on the events that have happened the corporation did appear to have established
                a special fund to provide for the maintenance work. The expenditure to the maintenance
                work is ‘a kind not expected by the manager to be incurred annually’. By a resolution
                passed at the meeting of the owners held on 19 November 2005 the amount to be contributed
                by the residential owners was decided. Unlike s 22(2) there is no provision in s 4
                that in default of provisions of the DMC on the method of computation, the ‘share
                rate’ will apply.
            </p>
            <p id="33">There is no Respondent’s Notice that the special fund comes within the ambit of the
                general or contingency funds. There was no argument before the Judge that a ‘special
                fund’ bank account has not been established in accordance with s 4(3).
            </p>
            <p><b>Column 5 of the Second Schedule</b></p>
            <p id="34">It is then necessary to decide whether the decision by the owners to use the ‘flat’
                rate contradicted other provisions of the DMC, or whether it is in fact consistent
                with its provisions.
            </p>
            <p id="35">The respondent contended that the proper method of computation should be based on
                the 5th Column of the Second Schedule of the DMC. This has always been his approach,
                commencing from the time when he filed the notice of opposition in the Lands Tribunal.
            </p>
            <p id="36">The relevant parts of the Second Schedule are as follows:</p>
            <p id="37"></p>
            <p id="37">In my view the method of computation in the 5th Column is not applicable. The DMC
                draws a distinction between the estate’s common areas and the estate’s common facilities
                on the one hand, and the block’s common areas and the block’s common facilities on
                the other. The last two items referred to the residential areas. Although the estate
                is defined as the whole of the development, the definition of the estate’s common
                areas and the estate’s common facilities do not include the common areas and common
                facilities of the residential part.
            </p>
            <p><b>The estate</b></p>
            <p id="38">The definition of the estate’s common areas is as follows:</p>
            <p id="39">The definition of the Estate’s Common Facilities is as follows:</p>
            <p id="40">The definition of the Estate’s Common Areas referred to the communal areas of the
                ‘level’. The reference to the ‘level’ obviously means the commercial part of the development.
                Further, if the estate’s common parts include both the commercial and residential
                parts, then there is no need to specify in (e) ‘Footpaths, steps and staircases not
                within   each Block.’. This is another indication that the estate’s common areas do
                not include the residential blocks.
            </p>
            <p id="41">While item (m) may be construed to include the residential parts as well, considering
                the whole of the provisions I do not accept that item (m) embraces the residential
                parts.
            </p>
            <p id="42">In respect of the estate’s common facilities, items (b) and (f) further expressly
                exclude the residential parts. By contrast, the Block’s common parts and the Block’s
                common facilities are clearly referable to the residential buildings:
            </p>
            <p id="43">I find that the 5th column is not applicable because it is not referable to further
                contributions of management expenses relating to the common parts and common facilities
                of the residential buildings. I would reserve my decision on the question whether
                the Judge was correct to hold that because the 668,522 shares referred to in the 5th
                column is ambiguous and does not match the number of shares that had previously been
                identified in the DMC, least they therefore should be disregarded even in the event
                that the 5th column is to be applied.
            </p>
            <p><b>The ‘flat’ rate method</b></p>
            <p id="44">If the method of computation is not decided by the 5th column then one has to see
                whether the ‘flat’ rate method adopted by the applicant is correct. The 3rd Column
                of the Second Schedule specified $200 per month per flat as the contribution of advance
                statement of management expenses. That amount has since been increased to $550 prior
                to the resolution of 19 November 2005.
            </p>
            <p id="45">Under clause 1 of sub-section B of Section V of the DMC, the manager was given ‘the
                full and unrestricted authority to do all such acts and things as may be necessary
                or requisite for the proper management of the estate’ which includes:
            </p>
            <p id="46">Under clause 1 of sub-section D of Section V, the owners of the estate shall pay a
                due proportion of the management expenses which shall be made up of the following:
            </p>
            <p id="47">In my view, the expenses relating to the maintenance of the area comes within the
                meaning of ‘management expenses’. Further under clause 2 of sub-section D of section
                V
            </p>
            <p>This imposes an obligation on the owners to contribute.</p>
            <p><b>Apportionment</b></p>
            <p id="48">In clause 6 of the same sub-section there is a provision for the apportionment of
                the management expenses in the event that the expenditure relates solely for the benefit
                of any residential unit or any commercial unit. In such a case the management expenses
                shall be paid by either of the owner of the residential unit or commercial unit:
            </p>
            <p id="49">The Judge construed ‘unit’ as referring to a single unit, and not the residential
                buildings as a whole. I do not agree. Quite apart from the fact that under the DMC
                there is the usual provision that singular shall include   the plural, in my view
                the intention of the DMC is really to draw a distinction between the commercial part
                and the residential part of the development, and that expenses relating to each part
                should not be brought upon the owner of the other part. This is a more consistent
                way of construing the DMC as a whole when there are already provisions drawing a distinction
                between the common parts and common facilities of the commercial and residential parts.
                The maintenance work is solely for the benefit of the residential owners. In such
                a case it would be unfair to adopt a method of contribution based on the shares of
                the individual owners of the development, the denominator of which is based on both
                the commercial and residential parts.
            </p>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p id="50">In the circumstances the appeal must be allowed. There is to be judgment against the
                respondent for the sum of $9,000 together with interest, the rate and duration of
                which are to be agreed by the parties for the Court’s approval.
            </p>
            <p id="51">I wish to express my concern that in many of the Lands Tribunal cases, proceedings
                are brought or resisted on disputes wherein the monetary value is extremely small,
                but the costs of the proceedings far exceed the value of the claim. The present case
                is a paradigm example. Quite apart from the fact that the claim is only $9,000, the
                difference in value of the various methods of calculation is extremely small indeed.
                Very often an owner who has lost his case will eventually lose his property because
                the property is charged and disposed of by the successful party in order to satisfy
                the costs’ order. Very often such property is the unsuccessful owner’s only asset
                of substance. In my view solicitors advising owners in such disputes are duty bound
                to spell out clearly to them, before instituting or contesting the proceedings, the
                costs’ implications and to give a realistic estimate of the likely costs to be incurred
                both in respect of the owner’s own costs and the opponent’s costs, together with a
                warning of the possible consequence of losing one’s flat in the event of losing his
                case.
            </p>
            <p><b>Costs</b></p>
            <p id="52">The applicant is entitled to a provisional costs order of the costs of the appeal
                and below. The costs below shall include the costs in the Small Claim Tribunal where
                the proceedings were first brought, together with certificate for counsel. Such costs
                are to be taxed on District Court Scale if not agreed.

            <p>By an Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (ALPA), the plaintiff became
                one of the limited partners of the 1st defendant whereby the 1st defendant was a conduit
                through which various professionals invested in an investment fund (Fund II). Fund
                II was an exempted limited partnership registered under the Exempted Limited Partnership
                Law of the Cayman Islands (ELP Law). One source of the plaintiff’s income was based
                on returns on Fund II’s investments under the ALPA (Carried Interests). Under articles
                7.1(a) and (c) of the ALPA, the plaintiff’s entitlement to the Carried Interests would
                be reduced, should he become an ‘Inactive
                Partner’ under certain circumstances including that the plaintiff committed any act
                constituting ‘Cause’, which  included, inter alia, a breach of section 3.2 headed
                ‘Non-Interference Covenants’, which included provisions for non-solicitation, confidentiality,
                non-competition and non-disparagement. Proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c) (Proviso (iv))
                provided that if the plaintiff’s status as a limited partner should end due to Termination
                with Cause after 1 November 2006, his entitlement to Carried Interest would be reduced
                by 95%. The plaintiff was a member of the investment committee of Fund II, which would
                decide the investments to be taken up by the fund. In about February 2006, the investment
                committee agreed to invest in a technology company using the structure of a wholly
                owned foreign enterprise incorporated in the PRC (WOFE). The plaintiff departed from
                Fund II in February 2007 and joined another fund (KPCB) shortly thereafter. The defendants
                alleged that between 2006 and 2007, the plaintiff had committed various misconducts
                which constituted Cause, and that by an investment agreement on 24 August 2007 (Xinrui
                Investment Agreement) whereby plaintiff was the deal champion for the investment on
                behalf of KPCB, the plaintiff was involved in the development and commercialisation
                of the Diandao or Point Advertising Technology which should have been developed or
                monetised by WOFE. The plaintiff commenced legal proceedings for Carried Interest
                under the ALPA and a Separation Agreement between the parties in 2006 (SA). The defendants
                counterclaimed, inter alia, for damages on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty in
                respect of his involvement in the development and commercialisation of the Diandao
                or Point Advertising Technology. A judge of the Court of First Instance gave judgment
                for the plaintiff on the claim and also upheld the counterclaim based on breach of
                fiduciary duty only, ordered that the plaintiff should disgorge the profits he made
                personally as a result of the Xinrui Investment Agreement and later on made a ruling
                on how to take account of such profits (Accounts Ruling). The plaintiff appealed against
                the upholding of the counterclaim, contending  inter alia that (i) the trial judge
                erred in law in holding that the plaintiff owed fiduciary duties to the 1st defendant,
                and (ii) the absence of jurisdiction to enter judgment against the plaintiff on the
                counterclaim. As to the Accounts Ruling, the plaintiff contended that the trial judge
                had become functus officio when the Accounts Ruling was made and it required disclosure
                of wide-ranging commercially sensitive information that was out with the original
                decision on the counterclaim. The defendant cross-appealed, challenging the trial
                judge’s finding on the proper construction of relevant clauses in the ALPA and the
                SA and that the trial judge should have held that the plaintiff was obliged to disclose
                his breaches of duty to the defendants prior to entering into the SA or upon commencement
                of his breaches and by not so disclosing was guilty of an implied misrepresentation
                that there was no wrongdoing to disclose.

                was consistent with and conformed to them. In a commercial relationship of a generally
                non-fiduciary kind, fiduciary obligations of loyalty may be engaged if one party was
                entitled to rely upon the other, not just for adherence to the contractual arrangements,
                but also for loyal performance of some function which the other had either agreed
                or assumed by conduct to perform. Here, the fiduciary duties owed by the plaintiff
                was based on contractual relationship under the ALPA. The imposition of fiduciary
                duties would not require a rewriting of the relevant contractual structures since
                it would not be inconsistent with the ELP Law and the way the Fund II entities were
                structured or the ALPA. The provisions in the ALPA and the entire agreement clause
                also did not preclude the existence of fiduciary duties. Hospital Products Ltd v United

            <p>(2)	 A fiduciary’s duty of loyalty was absolute and it was irrelevant whether the
                principal could have made use of the business opportunity for itself. It was a question
                of fact and degree whether the taking of preparatory steps for the future whilst still
                in a fiduciary relationship would be regarded as permissible or in breach of fiduciary
                duties. The plaintiff in the present case went over the boundary of what was permissible
                and there was no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s finding. Kao Lee &amp; Yip

            <p>(3)	The court was obliged to ensure that all parties necessary for the determination
                of a dispute were brought before it. The trial judge’s approach requiring the defendants
                to hold on trust for Fund II, a non-party, the profit made on the Xinrui Investment
                Agreement to be disgorged by the plaintiff remained to be a claim brought by the defendants
                which they were entitled to, without the need to join Fund II and the limited partners
                as parties. Such approach did not contravene the rule that an agent may not sue a
                non-party on behalf of the principal in its own name.  The approach was viable under
                the provisions of the relevant partnership agreements, did not fall foul of any principle
                in law and was procedurally feasible. Performing Right Society Ltd v London Theatre

            <p>(4) To establish the applicability of the reflective loss principle, it was incumbent
                on the plaintiff to (i) specifically identify which entity that would have a reflective
                claim and (ii) specifically establish a claim available to such entity to recover
                the same loss. In the present case, the entity having a reflective claim was not identified.
                Also, it would be unfair to allow the point of reflective loss to be run on appeal.

            </p>
            <p>(5)	The doctrine of functus officio had no application to the Accounts Ruling. The
                order for the judgment provided that the 1st defendant shall have liberty to seek
                directions, thereby reserving the issue of detailed directions that may be given for
                the taking of the accounts. The order for accounts did not exceeded the permissible
                bounds. Given the plaintiff's untruthful account and the relative scarcity of the
                discovery he provided, an order wider than the conventional order for account of secret
                profits to be given by a fiduciary was appropriate (paras 129-130, 132-135).

            <p>(6) For interpretation of contracts, commercial common sense was not to be invoked
                retrospectively. The mere fact that a contractual arrangement, if interpreted according
                to its natural language, had worked out badly, or even disastrously, for one of the
                parties is not a reason for departing from the natural language. The defendants’ case
                of relying on Proviso (iv) in the cross-appeal to reduce the plaintiff’s entitlement
                to Carried Interest by 95% failed in limine as they were unable to bring themselves
                within the Proviso. Arnold v Britton[2015] AC 1619 referred to (paras 161-162).

            <p>
                
                (8)	The line of argument that the scope of the duty to disclose is broad and extends
                to knowledge of ‘potential or preliminary wrongdoing’ was not mentioned in the defendants’
                pleading or raised at the trial and it would not be fair to allow this to be run for
                the first time on appeal.  Assuming that it was incumbent on a fiduciary to disclose
                his own misconduct, the misconduct relied on in the present case to found the claim
                in misrepresentation were not established on the facts. Flywin Co Ltd v Strong &amp; Associates

            <h2>Judgment</h2>
            <p><b>A. INTRODUCTION</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>A1. The judgment, costs ruling and accounts ruling</b></p>
            <p id="1">  On 14 February 2018, Deputy High Court Judge Field handed down judgment in a dispute
                between a private equity fund and one of its former limited partners, Joe Zhixiong
                Zhou, who is the plaintiff in this action.  The trial had lasted 11 days in January
                2018.  He gave judgment for the plaintiff against the 1st and 2nd defendants in respect
                of the plaintiff’s claim for sums due under the provisions of an Amended and Restated
                Limited Partnership Agreement dated 29 June 2005 (‘the ALPA’) and a Separation Agreement
                dated 11 December 2006 (‘the SA’).  As a result, the defendants were ordered to pay
                the plaintiff the judgment sum of US$22,430,369.66, with pre-judgment interest in
                the sum of US$6,002,101 plus interest at the judgment rate from the date of judgment
                until payment.
            </p>
            <p id="2">  The judge however found the plaintiff in breach of fiduciary duty in respect of
                his involvement in the development and commercialisation of a technology known as
                the Diandao or Point Advertising Technology This technology prompts an advertisement
                to pop up when an individual clicks his cursor on certain key words appearing on a
                webpage. It is purely reactive and does not depend on a user profile. . Hence, he
                ordered the plaintiff to disgorge any profit he made personally as a result of an
                investment agreement dated 24 August 2007 (‘the Xinrui Investment Agreement’) that
                the plaintiff was involved in acting for a party thereto.  An order was made for all
                necessary enquiries and accounts be taken to identify such profits made by the plaintiff
                and liberty was given to the 1st defendant to seek directions for the taking of such
                accounts.  All the other heads of counterclaim were dismissed. 
            </p>
            <p id="3">  On 25 April 2018, the judge gave his ruling on costs (‘the Costs Ruling’). He ordered
                the defendants to pay the costs of the plaintiff’s claim for sums due under the ALPA
                and the SA and the costs of the counterclaim for damages down to the point the defendants
                abandoned this head of the counterclaim a few days before the trial.  In respect of
                the remaining heads of counterclaim for an account of profits, the judge ordered the
                plaintiff to pay the defendants 65% of the costs of the account of profits counterclaim.
            </p>
            <p id="4">  On 26 June 2018, the judge handed down his ruling on how the taking of an account
                of the profit made by the plaintiff personally as a result of the Xinrui Investment
                Agreement should be taken (‘the Accounts Ruling’).  He ordered inter alia as follows:
            </p>
            <p><b>A2. The plaintiff’s appeal and the defendants’ cross-appeal</b></p>
            <p id="5">  The plaintiff’s appeal is against the judgment, the Accounts Ruling and the Costs
                Ruling.
            </p>
            <p id="6">  In respect of the judgment, the plaintiff seeks to challenge the decision on the
                counterclaim.  The most important contentions are two: (1) the judge erred in law
                in holding that the plaintiff owed fiduciary duties to the 1st defendant; and (2)
                the absence of jurisdiction to enter judgment against the plaintiff on the counterclaim
                ‘(a) in favour of unidentified non-parties; (b) in respect of unpleaded substantive
                claims that had never been tried; (c) for reflective rights or entitlements of non-parties;
                and (d) which ... the defendants and their affiliated non-parties chose not to advance
                in the Action below’ Plaintiff’s Skeleton Argument in the plaintiff’s appeal, §7(B)(4)..
                Mr Barlow SC With Mr Chan Pat Lun submitted on the plaintiff’s behalf that if he succeeds
                on either contention, that will decide both the plaintiff’s appeal against the judgment
                and the defendant’s cross-appeal.
            </p>
            <p id="7">  As regards the Accounts Ruling, the plaintiff’s contention is that that part of
                the order as quoted above is wrong in law because the judge had become functus officio
                when he made it, and it required disclosure of wide-ranging commercially sensitive
                information that was out with the original decision on the counterclaim.  Further,
                the order exceeded the permissible bounds for an order to account.
            </p>
            <p id="8">  The Costs Ruling is attacked on the basis that the costs order is ‘perverse and
                incorrect’.
            </p>
            <p id="9">  The defendants’ cross-appeal seeks to challenge the judgment on the plaintiff’s
                claim.  Three main points were taken by Mr Manzoni SC With Mr Alexander Tang. The
                first two relate to the proper construction of relevant clauses in the ALPA (‘the
                proviso (iv) point’) and the SA (‘the clause 8 point’).  The third point is that the
                judge should have held that the plaintiff was obliged to disclose his breaches of
                duty to the defendants prior to entering into the SA or upon commencement of his breaches
                and by not so disclosing was guilty of an implied misrepresentation that there was
                no wrongdoing to disclose.  The defendants are therefore entitled to rescind the SA,
                alternatively to recover damages against the plaintiff the net effect of which is
                to extinguish the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety (‘the misrepresentation point’).
            </p>
            <p><b>B. BACKGROUND</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>B1. The parties and the private equity fund structure</b></p>
            <p id="10">  ‘SAIF Partners’ is a group of entities trading under that name. SAIF Partners is
                not a legal entity.  It provides growth capital to companies in Asia, with particular
                focus on growth-oriented investments in information technology, internet, mobile,
                consumer products and services, healthcare, clean technology, education, modern agriculture,
                financial services and manufacturing, especially in China, India and South Korea.
                The focus of its investments is to provide funding to growth stage companies and to
                assist in their expansion.  SAIF Partners will then exit the investment at a suitable
                time.  The majority of the funding of SAIF Partners comes from external investors.
            </p>
            <p id="11">  The managing partner of SAIF Partners is Andrew Y Yan (‘Mr Yan’).  He established
                the first private equity fund, SoftBank Asia Infrastructure Fund LP (‘Fund I’), in
                2001 and the second one, SB Asia Investment Fund II LP (‘Fund II’), in 2004.  It is
                the investments of Fund II that feature in this litigation.
            </p>
            <p id="12">  Fund II is an exempted limited partnership registered under the Exempted Limited
                Partnership Law (2003 Revision) of the Cayman Islands and any successor to such statute
                (‘the ELP Law’).  Under the ELP Law, an exempted limited partnership consists of general
                partners and limited partners.  A general partner is liable for all debts and obligations
                of the partnership in the event that the assets of the partnership are inadequate,
                may hold assets of the partnership and conduct business for the partnership including
                the incurring of debts and the making of contracts and transactions.  A limited partner
                is not liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership save as provided in
                the partnership agreement and shall not take part in the conduct of business of the
                partnership ELP Law, sections 4(2), 6, 7.
            </p>
            <p id="13">  The general partner of Fund II is SAIF II GP LP (‘the Fund General Partner’).  The
                limited partners are external investors who are mainly institutional investors.  Their
                relationship is governed by a partnership agreement referred to in the judgment as
                ‘the Fund II LPA’. The limited partners provided almost all of the capital for investments
                but do not take part in the management or control of Fund II.  Fund II has no direct
                operations; it maintains interests in a variety of portfolio companies with underlying
                businesses.
            </p>
            <p id="14">  The Fund General Partner is structured in a similar way.  It is also a Cayman Islands
                exempted limited partnership.  Its general partner is SAIF Partners II LP, the 1st
                defendant in this action.  Its limited partner is an external investor Cisco Systems,
                Inc, whose investments in Fund II are channelled through a Cayman Islands limited
                liability company SB Asia Pacific Investments Ltd.  The relationship of the partners
                is governed by a partnership agreement referred to in the judgment as ‘the SAIF II
                GP LPA’.  As the limited partner, Cisco Systems, Inc and SB Asia Pacific Investments
                Ltd do not hold management control over the Fund General Partner.
            </p>
            <p id="15">  The last level in the fund structure is the 1st defendant.  Like the other general
                partners mentioned above, it is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership.  Its
                general partner is the 2nd defendant, SAIF II GP Capital Ltd.  The 2nd defendant is
                a Cayman Islands exempted limited liability company.  The sole shareholder and director
                of the 2nd defendant is Mr Yan.  At all material times, the limited partners of the
                1st defendant were the plaintiff and other key investment professionals.  The partnership
                relationship is governed by the ALPA.  The 1st defendant served as a conduit through
                which the investment professionals made their investments in Fund II, as there is
                a committed capital contribution to the 1st defendant under the ALPA.  This action
                is concerned with the rights and obligations of the plaintiff in the partnership which
                is the 1st defendant.
            </p>
            <p id="16">  I annex to this judgment a diagram showing the fund structure described above. 
                It is Mr Yan who controlled the 1st defendant, the 2nd defendant, and the operations
                of Fund II.  The structure adopted is common to fund management equity, with due regard
                to international taxation and regulatory considerations.
            </p>
            <p id="17">  Under the Fund II LPA, Fund II must pay an annual management fee of 2% of the total
                committed capital of Fund II (in the first five years) or 2% of the remaining assets
                of Fund II (in the later five years) to SAIF Management II Ltd (‘the Fund Manager’).
                In addition, Fund II must pay 20% of the profits realised on Fund II’s investments
                to the Fund General Partner.  These will then be passed on by the Fund General Partner
                to the 1st defendant in accordance with the terms of the SAIF II GP LPA.
            </p>
            <p id="18">  Under the terms of the ALPA, the 20% of the profits realised on Fund II’s investments
                passed on to the 1st defendant from the Fund General Partner will be divided up among

            <p id="19">  In or about 2001, the plaintiff was employed as an investment officer with Fund
                I.  In this connection, Sunstep Co Ltd (‘Sunstep’) entered into a consulting services
                agreement with the plaintiff on 1 January 2002 (to cover offshore activities outside
                China) and SAIF Advisors (Beijing) Limited (‘SAIF BJ’) entered into an employment
                contract with him on 26 November 2002 (to cover onshore activities in China).  The
                plaintiff was a salaried employee of SAIF BJ and a fee-earning consultant of Sunstep.
                SAIF BJ and Sunstep were affiliates of the Fund Manager and the 1st defendant.

            <p id="20">  When Fund II was set up in 2004, the plaintiff was invited by Mr Yan to become a
                limited partner of the 1st defendant.  He was one of the six investment professionals
                promoted to the level of partner by Mr Yan. He agreed and signed the partnership agreement
                in December 2004, which was amended in June 2005 and became the ALPA.

                of ‘Partner’ of SAIF Partners on its website and business cards. and a ‘Core Principal’
                ‘Core Principals’ is defined in the ALPA as meaning each of Mr Yan, Mr Lin, the plaintiff

                He had responsibility, together with the other limited partners and Mr Yan, for the
                investment activity of Fund II.  The Principal Limited Partners were drawn from SAIF
                Partners’ most senior and high ranking professional staff.  The plaintiff was a member

                the terms of the approved investments and supervising the investments once a transaction
                had been completed, which often meant serving on the board of the relevant portfolio
                company in whose share capital Fund II had invested.  By mid-2006, the plaintiff was
                serving on the boards of 14 portfolio companies, of which ten belonged to Fund II.
            </p>
            <p id="26">  The plaintiff received income from SAIF Partners in at least three ways: remuneration
                in his capacity as a salaried employee and a fee-earning consultant of the Fund Manager’s
                affiliates (which in turn derived their income through management fees paid by Fund
                II); distribution based on investment return on his capital contribution under the

            <p><b>B3. Fund II’s investment in Show World</b></p>
            <p id="27">  In about October 2015, the plaintiff identified a technology company in the PRC
                as a potential investment opportunity for Fund II.  This was Show World Information
                Technology Co Ltd (‘Show World’) that had been established by Zhou Yang.  The plaintiff
                and his deal team (Yanchao Zhao (‘Mr Zhao’) and Lynda Lau (‘Ms Lau’)) produced a ‘Concept
                Paper’ on Show World in December 2005, for distribution to other ‘Partners and Professionals’.
                It stated that Show World was the dominant player in both avatar Personalised virtual

            </p>
            <p id="28">  In early 2006, the plaintiff laid before the Investment Committee an Investment
                Report on Show World, which covered much of the ground in the Concept Paper.  In addition,
                it stated that SAIF was considering investing US$8 million for 4,210,526 Series A
                Preferred Shares (about 29.31% of the ownership of the company post-closing) and US$2
                million of warrants for 877,193 Series A shares at 120% of Series A initial pre-money
                valuation.  There would be ratchet terms with a target of earnings of US$3 million
                as shown in the financial statements for 2006.
            </p>
            <p id="29">  In February 2006, the Investment Committee agreed to invest US$8 million in Show
                World in two tranches.  The structure used involved the incorporation of a Cayman
                Islands company, My Show Group Limited (‘My Show’), which then established a wholly
                owned foreign enterprise incorporated in the PRC called Beijing Show World Science
                and Technology Co Ltd (‘the WOFE’).
            </p>
            <p id="30">  On 5 April 2006, My Show, Fund II, Zhou Yang and Show World executed a share purchase
                agreement (‘the My Show SPA’) by which it was agreed that: (1) Fund II would acquire
                2,631,579 Series A Preferred Shares in My Show at US$5 million and, at a later date
                would, if certain conditions were met, acquire further shares up to 1,578,947 at US$3
                million; (2) subsequent to the execution of the My Show SPA, Zhou Yang, My Show and
                Show World would effectuate a plan of restructuring involving an asset transfer agreement,
                under which the WOFE, with Zhou Yang as its general manager, would assume control
                of substantially all of Show World’s operations and be entitled to receive substantially
                all of the income generated by Show World; and (3) My Show and Zhou Yang would execute
                a founder purchase agreement (‘the FPA’), under which Zhou Yang was to be issued shares
                in My Show, if one of two conditions was met; in the event neither condition was met,
                the parties would use best efforts to agree an alternative means to achieve the FPA,
                failing which they were to take all reasonable actions necessary to reverse the transactions
                completed pursuant to the plan of restructuring.
            </p>
            <p id="31">  Under the above structure adopted for the investment in Show World, Fund II became
                the majority shareholder in My Show until the execution and implementation of the
                FPA.  In the meantime, Zhou Yang would have no direct or indirect shareholding in
                the WOFE at a time when the assets of Show World were transferred to the WOFE.
            </p>
            <p id="32">  In conjunction with the My Show SPA, Zhou Yang entered into a letter agreement with
                My Show (‘the My Show Covenant’) by which he undertook to refrain from acting in other
                positions, engage in any other job or receive financial benefit or advantage from
                others and to devote all of his work and effort exclusively towards the fulfilment
                of his service obligations to My Show and/or its affiliates during a defined ‘Commitment
                Period’.
            </p>
            <p id="33">  The plaintiff was appointed to the board of My Show and he also became a director
                and the legal representative of the WOFE.
            </p>
            <p><b>B4. How the SA came to be made and its provisions</b></p>
            <p id="34">  By mid-2006, Fund II had become fully invested and Mr Yan began discussing the idea
                of a new investment fund that subsequently became Fund III.  On about 23 August 2006,
                the plaintiff told Mr Yan that he did not wish to be a limited partner in Fund III
                because he wanted to establish his own investment fund.  Mr Yan was not happy at the
                prospect of the plaintiff leaving SAIF Partners and felt he might no longer trust
                the plaintiff.  News of the plaintiff’s possible departure started to leak out and
                Mr Yan thought that this might deter the investors in Fund II from investing in Fund
                III.
            </p>
            <p id="35">  Following a period of negotiation, the SA was executed by the plaintiff and Mr Yan
                on 11 December 2006.  Unlike the ALPA and the partnership agreements for Fund II and
                the Fund General Partner which are highly detailed agreements drafted by skilled expert
                lawyers, the SA was not drafted by lawyers.  The judge gave a summary of its provisions
                as follows Judgment, §§50 to 57:
            </p>
            <p id="36">  Under the ALPA, if the plaintiff had stayed as a limited partner throughout, he
                would be entitled to 16.59% of the 1st defendant’s profits.  By article 7.1(a) and
                (c), his entitlement to the Carried Interest would be reduced if he should become
                an ‘Inactive Partner’ under any of the following circumstances (each, a ‘Trigger Event’):
                (i) he ceases to be an employee of the Fund Manager or its affiliates or to perform
                services for the 1st defendant, Fund II, the Fund Manager or their affiliates for
                any reason; (ii) he gives notice of voluntary termination as an employee of the Fund
                Manager or its affiliates; (iii) he is given notice of his involuntary termination
                as an employee of the Fund Manager or its affiliates; or (iv) he commits any act (or
                failure to act) constituting ‘Cause’.
            </p>
            <p id="37">  ‘Cause’ is defined in article 11.1 to mean:</p>
            <p id="38">  The reduction to the entitlement to Carried Interest on the occurrence of a Trigger
                Event is calculated by multiplying the points allocation of the limited partner with
                an ‘Applicable Percentage’.  The Applicable Percentage would depend on inter alia
                these factors:
            </p>
            <p>(1) The timing at which the plaintiff left</p>
            <p id="39">  Under article 7.1(c), the plaintiff’s Applicable Percentage would be zero if he
                should become an Inactive Partner before 1 November 2006 (the first anniversary of
                the Final Closing). After that, he would get a base Applicable Percentage of 20.24%
                and for each additional month he stayed, his Applicable Percentage would increase
                by 1.66%.
            </p>
            <p>(2) Whether the plaintiff had committed ‘Cause’</p>
            <p id="40">  If the plaintiff’s status as a limited partner should end ‘due to Termination with
                Cause’ after 1 November 2006, his Applicable Percentage would be reduced by 95%, pursuant
                to proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c). This is the ‘proviso (iv) point’ pursued by the
                defendants below and on appeal.
            </p>
            <p id="41">  Based on the timing at which the plaintiff decided to leave, his Applicable Percentage
                would have been 36.84% under article 7.1(c) of ALPA. However, by clause 8 of the SA,
                he was given an additional nine months’ vesting at 1.66% per month, whereby his Applicable
                Percentage would increase to 51.78% (36.84% + 1.66% x 9) on final vesting.
            </p>
            <p id="42">  The plaintiff’s salary and his work in respect of Fund II ceased as from 28 February
                2007 and during March 2007 he resigned from the various directorships he held on the
                board of the portfolio companies of Fund II.

            <p id="43">  Following his departure from Fund II, the plaintiff joined Kleiner Perkins Caulfield
                &amp; Bayes (‘KPCB’) and participated in the launch of KPCB China Fund LP on 24 April
                2007.
            </p>
            <p id="44">  On 24 August 2007, the Xinrui Investment Agreement was made between Keygate Technologies

            </p>
            <p id="45">  In April 2008, having left KPCB, the plaintiff set up Keytone Ventures LP (‘KV’).</p>
            <p id="46">  Sometime around July/August 2008, Mr Zhao acting on the instructions of Mr Yan,
                began an investigation into the affairs of the WOFE and My Show.  Certified public
                accountants were instructed to carry out an investigatory audit of transactions between
                the WOFE, Xinrui, Beijing My Show Advertising Co Ltd (‘My Show Ad’) and Beijing Wu
                Xian Wei Ke Science and Technology Co Ltd (‘Mobile Winks’).  The auditors’ report

                Applicable Percentage had been reduced by 95% and alleging that this was a ‘Termination
                with Cause’ under proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c) of the ALPA in that he had committed
                Cause by conducting himself in a manner that adversely affected one or more of the
                1st defendant, Fund II and Fund II’s portfolio companies.
            </p>
            <p id="48">  The alleged conduct of the plaintiff said to constitute Cause spanned the time from
                April 2006 when he was still an active limited partner down to and after the SA and
                his subsequent departure from SAIF Partners on 28 February 2007.  The defendants further
                contended that the conduct alleged to constitute Cause also constituted breaches of
                fiduciary duties owed by the plaintiff to the 1st and/or 2nd defendants.
            </p>
            <p id="49">  The alleged misconduct was summarised by the judge as follows Judgment, §43:</p>
            <p id="50">  In October 2010, the plaintiff issued a writ in this action (HCA 1551/2010) against
                the 1st defendant to claim damages for breach of the SA by reason of the failure to
                pay his entitlement to distributions attributable to Carried Interest under the ALPA.
                The writ was amended in September 2011 to add the 2nd defendant.  The defendants served
                their defence and counterclaim in November 2012.  The action was transferred to the

            <p><b>C. THE HOLDINGS IN THE JUDGMENT</b></p>
            <p id="51">  The parties’ main contentions were summarised by the judge as follows:</p>
            <p id="52">  The judge stated the following conclusions on his findings on the meaning and effect
                of the SA and the ALPA:
            </p>
            <p id="53">  The plaintiff’s claim for unpaid Carried Interest therefore succeeded.</p>
            <p id="54">  The judge held that the plaintiff was under a fiduciary duty not to act contrary
                to, or put his own interest before, the interests of the 1st defendant and those of
                his Fund II co-partners Judgment, §108.  He made these findings on the alleged misconduct

            <p><b>(1) The US$2.5 million loan</b></p>
            <p id="55">  The defendants’ claim for breach of fiduciary duty in respect of the US$2.5 million
                loan to Zhou Yang failed on the facts.  The judge found that the plaintiff honestly
                believed that the money would be used to meet the WOFE’s working capital requirements
                and that Zhou Yang could be trusted to use the money for those purposes. Judgment,

            <p></p>
            <p><b>D2.1 If fiduciary duties were owed by the plaintiff</b></p>
            <p id="71">  Mr Barlow repeated his submissions before the judge They were summarised in §106
                of the judgment and dealt with by the judge succinctly.. He placed great emphasis
                on the structure of the Fund II entities, that they chose to set up in the Cayman
                Islands for tax and regulatory advantages.  The structure of those entities was chosen
                to preclude any possibility that offshore jurisdictions (such as the PRC) might consider
                the fact that the investment professionals were working there to be indicative of
                the 1st defendant and/or Fund II carrying on business there.  All the contractual
                connections were adopted with written contracts each containing an ‘entire agreement’
                clause Article 12.12 of ALPA provides: ‘This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
                among the Partners with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
                agreement or understanding among them with respect to such subject matter.’.  The
                management of the affairs of Fund II was contracted out to the Fund Manager, and the
                affiliates of the Fund Manager entered into consultancy and employment contracts with
                investment professionals like the plaintiff.
            </p>
            <p id="72">  Further in support of his contention it was the clear intention of the parties to
                the ALPA that limited partners such as the plaintiff would not owe fiduciary duties
                to the 1st defendant, Mr Barlow pointed to the ELP Law, which, in his submission,
                makes the general partner the agent and fiduciary of the exempted limited partnership,
                with sole control over the partnership assets and excludes the limited partner from
                the rights and obligations of taking part in the conduct of business of the partnership,
                of entering into contracts, deeds and instruments on behalf of the partnership. Similar
                provisions are contained in article 2 of the ALPA, which sets out the powers of the
                general partner (the 2nd defendant) and the limited partners (which included the plaintiff).
                By article 2.1, the management, control and operation of and the determination of
                policy shall be vested exclusively in the general partner, who shall carry out all
                of the powers of the partnership and perform all acts and enter into all contracts
                and undertakings.  By article 2.2, the actions of the general partner taken in accordance
                with the ALPA shall bind the 1st defendant’s assets. Article 2.3 provides that a limited
                partner shall not participate in the control of the 1st defendant’s business, transact
                any business in the 1st defendant’s name or otherwise bind the 1st defendant.  There
                is no provision in the ALPA providing for the assumption of fiduciary duties by the
                limited partners.
            </p>
            <p id="73">  In light of the above matters, he submitted that it would require a rewriting of
                the relevant elaborate contractual structures including the ALPA, which the ELP Law
                does not permit, to hold that the plaintiff should owe fiduciary duties to the 1st
                defendant.  He cited various dicta to make the point that ‘the fiduciary relationship
                cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a way as to alter the operation which
                the contract was intended to have according to its true construction’ (Hospital Products
                Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 97, per Mason J), that
                ‘the nature and terms of the contractual relationship between the parties will be
                determinative of the scope of the responsibility assumed’ (Henderson v Merrett Syndicates
                Ltd [1995] 2 AC 145 at 206E to F, per Lord Browne-Wilkinson ), and that ‘the scope
                of the fiduciary obligations both arises out of, and is circumscribed by, the contractual
                terms; it is circumscribed because equity cannot alter the terms of the contract validly
                undertaken’ (University of Nottingham v Fishel [2000] ICR 1462 at 1491, per Elias
                J ).
            </p>
            <p id="74">  It has never been in doubt that contractual and fiduciary relationship may co-exist
                between the same parties. As stated by Mason J in Hospital Products in the earlier
                part of the same extract at 97, the existence of a basic contractual relationship
                has in many situations provided a foundation for the erection of a fiduciary relationship.
                Mason J went on to say that it is the contractual foundation which is all important
                because it regulates the basic rights and liabilities of the parties and if the fiduciary
                relationship is to exist, it must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract
                so that it is consistent with and conforms to them.  Mason J further noted at 98 that
                in cases where a comprehensive fiduciary relationship does not exist, it does not
                exclude the existence of a more limited fiduciary relationship, for it is well settled
                that a person may be a fiduciary in some activities but not in others.
            </p>
            <p id="75">  It is also well settled that even in a commercial relationship of a generally non-fiduciary
                kind, there may be aspects which engage fiduciary obligations of loyalty, as explained
                by Blanchard J in Maruha Corp v Amaltal Corp [2007] 3 NZLR 192 at [21]:
            </p>
            <p id="76">  The first question to consider is whether, generally speaking, a limited partner
                in an exempted limited partnership may owe a fiduciary duty to the partnership under
                the ELP Law, notwithstanding the statutory provisions regarding the powers and obligations
                of the general and limited partners.  The three experts on Cayman Islands law Mr Nigel
                Meeson QC, Mr Richard de Lacy QC and Mr John Ross McDonough QC are in agreement about
                this as they have stated in the joint expert report:
            </p>
            <p id="77">  The question that follows is whether the particular circumstances here justify the
                imposition of fiduciary duties on the plaintiff and if so what should the fiduciary
                duties consist of.
            </p>
            <p id="78">  It is not in dispute that the law of the Cayman Islands governing the question whether
                the ALPA gives rise to any fiduciary duties owed by the plaintiff to the 1st defendant
                is the same as the applicable English law, which is the same as the applicable law
                of Hong Kong Judgment, §102.
            </p>
            <p id="79">  I agree with the judge that the entire agreement clause does not preclude the existence
                of fiduciary duties, if a party to the contract is under an obligation to act in the
                interests of another (which is the foundation of a fiduciary relationship), as it
                is trite law that entire agreement clauses do not preclude the implication of terms
                into a contract Judgment, §106. It is immaterial that there is no express provision
                in the ALPA providing for the assumption of fiduciary duties by the limited partners,
                or that the plaintiff was a salaried employee and a fee-earning consultant under separate
                contractual arrangements entered into for tax and regulatory reasons.  What is more
                important is the substance of the role and the actual responsibilities undertaken
                by the plaintiff with regard to the business of Fund II.
            </p>
            <p id="80">  I agree also with the judge that although the structure of the Fund II entities
                may have been designed to preclude the exposure of individuals to claims from external
                parties, it did not preclude claims between the parties to the agreements, as exemplified
                by article 3.2(f) of the ALPA, which provides that the partnership shall have the
                right to pursue all remedies at law or in equity available to it with respect to any
                of the covenants of each Limited Partner and Principal Limited Partner in article
                3.2 Judgment, §106.
            </p>
            <p id="81">  Nor do I think the provisions in articles 2.1 to 2.3 would exclude the existence
                of fiduciary duties.  As rightly pointed out by Mr Manzoni, these provisions delineate
                a limited partner’s powers vis-à-vis outside third parties qua limited partner, and
                do not deal with the duties of the limited partner amongst the partners themselves
                qua other capacities.  The last sentence of article 2.3 expressly provides that this
                article ‘shall not prevent any Person from acting on behalf of, or with respect to,
                the Partnership in a capacity other than as a limited partner’.
            </p>
            <p id="82">  The judge held that the nature of the fiduciary duties owed by the plaintiff is
                not to act contrary to, or put his own interest before, the interests of the 1st defendant
                and those of his Fund II co-partners Judgment, §108. This appears to me to be well
                justified by the covenants the plaintiff had taken on under the ALPA (in particular
                articles 3.1 and 3.2(b)), and the manner in which the limited partners expected each
                other to carry out their roles and activities under the ALPA, which has been described
                in some detail earlier in this judgment.  As noted by the judge, the partners were
                all entitled under article 6 to distributions paid out of 20% of the profits realised
                on Fund II’s investments, those profits being the result of the collective efforts
                of the partners to select and nurture investments for the benefit of the external
                investors, and the partners depended on each other for co-operation and expected each
                other to do their best in making a success of the business of Fund II Judgment, §109.
            </p>
            <p id="83">  In the discharge of the plaintiff’s responsibilities as a Limited Partner, a Principal
                Limited Partner and a member of the Investment Committee under the ALPA, and a Principal
                under the Fund II LPA, the co-partners of the plaintiff are clearly entitled to rely
                upon him, not just for adherence to contractual arrangements between them, but also
                for loyal performance of the obligations which he had undertaken to perform for the
                1st defendant, the Fund General Partner and Fund II.  
            </p>
            <p id="84">  I reject the submission that the imposition of fiduciary duties in this situation
                would be inconsistent with the ELP Law, the way the Fund II entities were structured,
                or the ALPA.  Far from re-writing the contract as contended by Mr Barlow, the judge
                had relied on the contractual relationship as foundation to hold that fiduciary duties
                were owed by the plaintiff in this instance.
            </p>
            <p><b>D2.2 If the plaintiff had breached fiduciary duties</b></p>
            <p id="85">  The plaintiff contended even if (contrary to his primary case) he did owe fiduciary
                duties to his co-partners, the defendants failed to make out any case that he had
                breached those duties either by (a) depriving the 1st defendant or the Fund II investors
                of any obtainable business opportunity or by placing himself in a conflict of interest
                or by obtaining the opportunity to make a secret profit for himself; or (b) depriving
                the 1st defendant or the Fund II investors of any business opportunity that the 1st
                defendant had not waived.
            </p>
            <p id="86">  In respect of (a), it was argued that such conduct could not constitute a breach
                because it was not an opportunity the 1st defendant, Fund II or the WOFE would be
                able to take up because: Fund II’s investment in the My Show companies was capped
                at US$8 million; by mid-2006, Fund II had become ‘fully invested’ meaning that it
                could not raise funds for new investment opportunities (which would be directed to
                Fund III); and KPCB China Fund LP had made an investment of US$8 million to fund the
                new technology under the Xinrui Investment Agreement.
            </p>
            <p id="87">  It was further submitted that the plaintiff’s dealings with Zhou Yang about an investment
                in an entity that would develop the Diandao technology, which took place after the
                SA had been executed, could at most only constitute preparatory steps that a fiduciary
                is entitled to take for his future livelihood, even when he is still subject to his
                duty, and in relation to a non-tangible and immature business opportunity, citing
                Kao Lee &amp; Yip v Koo Hoi Yan &amp; Ors [2003] 3 HKLRD 296 at §§57(5), 70 to 76 and 118;
                and Foster Bryant Surveying Ltd v Bryant [2007] Bus LR 1565 at §8.  The judge had
                therefore disregarded the speculative and developmental nature of the later investment
                in Xinrui by KPCB and was wrong in principle.
            </p>
            <p id="88">  As for the waiver in (b), reliance was placed on the penultimate sentence of clause
                7 of the SA which reads: ‘For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby acknowledged and
                agreed that as of the Marketing Date Joe shall not be subject to any non-compete or
                similar restriction (including any provision that would reduce Joe’s vested interests)
                by reason of forming Newco or joining another fund.’
            </p>
            <p id="89">  The above arguments are entirely without merit.</p>
            <p id="90">  As submitted by Mr Manzoni, the breaches of fiduciary duties complained of went
                further than depriving the 1st defendant or the Fund II investors of a business opportunity.
                The plaintiff’s first breaches occurred when he acquiesced in and encouraged Zhou
                Yang’s wrongdoing with regard to the Diandao technology and had thereby solicited
                Zhou Yang to act in breach of the My Show Covenant.  He also breached the confidentiality
                covenant by which he was required not to disclose or use for his own benefit confidential
                information with respect to any portfolio company.  In relation to such breaches,
                it is not necessary to prove that the plaintiff had deprived the defendants of a business
                opportunity which the defendants were able to make use of.
            </p>
            <p id="91">  Besides, it is well established that a fiduciary’s duty of loyalty is absolute and
                it is irrelevant whether the principal could have made use of the business opportunity
                for itself (Waddington Ltd v Chan Chun Hoo Thomas[2016] HKCU 1192 , CACV 10/2014,
                20 May 2016, §§69 to 73).  The concept of a mature or tangible business opportunity
                is not relevant either, as a business opportunity is not germane to breaches of this
                nature.
            </p>
            <p id="92">  Kao Lee &amp; Yip v Koo Hoi Yan is of no assistance to the plaintiff.  It is a question
                of fact and degree whether the taking of preparatory steps for the future whilst still
                in a fiduciary relationship would be regarded as permissible or in breach of fiduciary
                duties.  Here, the plaintiff went over the boundary of what was permissible. As found
                by the judge, a week or so before 6 February 2007, the plaintiff was in serious discussions
                with Zhou Yang about investing in a company that would utilize the Diandao technology
                in competition with the WOFE and that amounted to solicitation Judgment, §§114, 170,
                172. There is no basis to interfere with this finding of fact.

            <p id="93">  As for waiver, this point was not run below nor was this raised in the supplementary
                notice of appeal. Waiver must be specifically pleaded and proven (Hong Kong Civil
                Procedure 2019, vol 1, §18/8/11).  I agree also with Mr Manzoni that the penultimate
                sentence of clause 7 of the SA cannot be construed as any sort of waiver of breaches
                committed by the plaintiff.

            <p><b>D2.3 If the wrong standard of proof was applied</b></p>
            <p id="94">  This may be dealt with shortly.  The plaintiff’s complaint is that the judge failed
                to apply the ‘higher standard of proof’ required to prove any claim of dishonest breach
                of fiduciary duty as regards the counterclaim relating to Xinrui.
            </p>
            <p id="95">  The judge was fully aware of and had cited Judgment, §133 the principle in In Re
                H (Minors)[1996] AC 563 at §§73 to 74, per Lord Nicholls. Dishonesty does not require
                a ‘higher standard of proof’, it only means that the inherent improbability of fraud
                is to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether,
                on balance, fraud was established.  The matters set out in the supplementary notice
                of appeal §10 do not support the contention that the judge had failed to apply the
                right standard of proof in his evaluation of the evidence.
            </p>
            <p><b>D3. Proper plaintiff and jurisdiction</b></p>
            <p id="96">  The judge noted that neither the external investors who contributed to Fund II (being
                the ultimate beneficiaries to whom the plaintiff owed the duty not to make a secret
                profit) nor Fund II are parties before the court.  And it is the case that the 1st
                defendant’s proprietary interest in the profit made by the plaintiff personally on
                the Xinrui Investment Agreement is limited to 20% of that profit that would have been
                transferred to the 1st defendant by the Fund General Partner.  The judge held that
                in order to avoid over-recovery by the 1st defendant and to protect the interests
                of Fund II, the 1st defendant must hold the profit made on the Xinrui Investment Agreement
                to be disgorged by the plaintiff on trust for Fund II Judgment, §§196 to 198.
            </p>
            <p id="97">  The plaintiff’s contention is that there is no jurisdiction to order him to account
                to the 1st defendant as trustee for non-parties who had chosen not to assert any such
                claims.  The argument runs as follows.
            </p>
            <p id="98">  There is confusion in the judge’s holdings.  He had at first held (incorrectly)
                that the plaintiff’s breaches arose out of the failure to secure for the WOFE the
                technology developed by Xinrui Judgment, §172, when, after 28 February 2007, the plaintiff
                was free to compete with Fund II by virtue of the penultimate sentence of clause 7
                of the SA.  When the judge came to consider the remedy for the plaintiff’s breach
                of fiduciary duty in respect of Xinrui, he held that the ultimate beneficiaries to
                whom the plaintiff owed fiduciary duties were the external investors who contributed
                to Fund II Judgment, §196. The first holding identified the WOFE as the entity to
                whom the claims belonged, whereas the second holding identified the Fund II investors
                as the parties or entities to whom the claims belonged.  These two holdings cannot
                be reconciled.
            </p>
            <p id="99">  The judge disregarded the fact that the Fund II investors were not before the court
                and had not asserted any claims in respect of the Xinrui counterclaim.  The only potential
                claimant was the WOFE.  The judge had no jurisdiction to determine any claim that
                the plaintiff had breached his fiduciary duties to the WOFE, because the WOFE was
                not made a party to this action and the defendants had no locus standi to claim on
                its behalf.  Furthermore, the defendants’ claims are reflective of the claims of the
                WOFE or Fund II or the Fund II investors and are precluded by the reflective loss
                principle.

                II nor the Fund General Partner is a party to the present proceedings and that the
                1st defendant is not entitled to bring claims against the plaintiff on behalf of these
                entities in these proceedings.  The 1st defendant cannot sue the plaintiff in its
                own name as an agent for a non-party, as proceedings taken by an agent have to be
                taken in the name of the principal, not the agent, see ChinaVest II-A, LP v Chan Kueng

            </p>
            <p id="102">  Contrary to the plaintiff’s submission, there is no confusion in the judge’s holdings.
                It was pleaded in the Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim that the plaintiff owed
                fiduciary duties to ‘SAIF Partners’ ‘SAIF Partners’ was defined in §3 of the Re-amended
                Defence and Counterclaim as referring to a group of entities which includes the 1st
                and 2nd defendants and Fund II trading under that name. (including the 1st and 2nd
                defendants and Fund II) by virtue of the relationship of the parties, his role and
                activities, and the trust and confidence reposed in him by the other limited partners
                Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim, §24.  The judge considered the question whether
                fiduciary duties were owed by the plaintiff to, inter alios, the 1st and 2nd defendants
                as pleaded and the nature of such duties[47].  As mentioned earlier, he found in favour
                of the defendants.  It is apparent from the discussion in §§106 to 108 of the judgment
                that these fiduciary duties were found to be owed to the 1st and 2nd defendants and
                Fund II.
            </p>
            <p id="103">  It is wrong to suggest that the judge had found that fiduciary duties were owed
                by the plaintiff to the WOFE.  The nature of the fiduciary duty owed by the plaintiff
                was ‘not to act contrary to, or put his own interest before, the interests of D1 and
                those of his Fund II co-partners’ Judgment, §108. Specifically in relation to the
                Xinrui investment, the judge found that the plaintiff, in acting as he did in conjunction
                with Zhou Yang from around late January 2007 down to the conclusion of the Xinrui
                Investment Agreement, had acted ‘in breach of his fiduciary duty owed to D1 in that
                he put his own interest ahead of the interest of D1 and his co-partners and thereby
                profited from his position held under the ALPA’ Judgment, §173.
            </p>
            <p id="104">  For the above reasons, the 1st and 2nd defendants are clearly entitled to bring
                this action on their own behalf pursuing remedies in respect of breaches of fiduciary
                duties owed by the plaintiff to them.  That the WOFE was not a party before the court
                is quite simply irrelevant (subject to the discussion below on reflective loss).
            </p>
            <p id="105">  What about the position of Fund II and the investors of Fund II being the limited
                partners thereof, who are not parties to this action?  The question is whether there
                is irregularity in the proceedings and what impact this may have on the judgment and
                the orders made.
            </p>
            <p id="106">  In ChinaVest II-A, LP v Chan Kueng Un Roy, the action was brought by ChinaVest II-A,
                LP, a Cayman Islands limited partnership, as the sole plaintiff, being the ‘disbursement
                agent’ appointed under a disbursement agreement to facilitate the disbursement to
                the sellers of the purchase price payable by the defendant under a share transfer
                agreement.  The sellers were the plaintiff and a number of different companies incorporated
                in various parts of the world. By an instrument headed ‘authorisation’, the plaintiff
                was authorised to initiate legal action on behalf of all the other sellers to seek
                recovery of all amounts owing under the share transfer agreement.  One of the points
                taken on appeal was whether the action was properly constituted.  The plaintiff originally
                argued that it was entitled to bring the action in its own name as the agent of the
                sellers. This was rejected by the Court of Appeal in that the law is clear, as proceedings
                taken by an agent have to be taken in the name of the principal, not the agent.  The
                reference in the statement of claim to the plaintiff acting as the authorised agent
                of the sellers would not be sufficient to justify the proceedings being brought in
                the sole name of the plaintiff.
            </p>
            <p id="107">  The plaintiff there eventually took another tack and relied on Order 15 rule 12(1),
                which provides that where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceedings,
                the proceedings may be begun by any one or more of them as representing all or as
                representing all except one or more of them.  The Court of Appeal permitted this course,
                noting that although the number of sellers were not in any sense numerous, all were
                content that the action should have been brought by the plaintiff as one of the sellers
                representing them all.  The Court of Appeal ordered all the sellers be added as plaintiffs
                in the proceedings (as it would be unsatisfactory to leave this as a representative
                action, where a number of sellers were incorporated outside the jurisdiction) and
                on that basis held the action to be properly constituted.
            </p>
            <p id="108">  It was pleaded in §60 of the Amended Counterclaim that so far as the 1st defendant’s
                entitlement to claim on behalf of Fund II is concerned, reliance is placed upon clause
                1.6(e) of the Fund II LPA, which gives the Fund General Partner the ability to bring
                proceedings on behalf of Fund II, and clause 1.6(g) of the SAIF II GP LPA, which in
                its turn gives the 1st defendant the ability to bring proceedings on behalf of the
                Fund General Partner.
            </p>
            <p id="109">  This seems to be missing the point.  The defendants may well be authorised to bring
                proceedings on behalf of Fund II, as was the plaintiff on behalf of the other sellers
                in ChinaVest II-A, LP.  But they would still need to overcome the rule that an agent
                may not sue on behalf of the principal in its own name.  Mr Manzoni did not seek an
                order from this court to appoint the defendants as representing Fund II and the limited
                partners of Fund II under Order 15 rule 12(1), or an order joining Fund II and all
                its limited partners as co-plaintiffs in the counterclaim under the inherent jurisdiction
                of the court.
            </p>
            <p id="110">  Granted that the defendants are not entitled to sue in its own name on behalf of
                Fund II and its limited partners, is there any other permissible way out for the defendants?
                The judge used the method of requiring the defendants to hold on trust for Fund II
                the profit made on the Xinrui Investment Agreement to be disgorged by the plaintiff.
                The counterclaim remains a claim brought by the defendants to pursue their remedy
                against the plaintiff for breach of fiduciary duties owed to them, which they are
                entitled to bring on their own, without joining Fund II and the limited partners of
                this fund.  Order 15 rule 4(2) does not apply to this situation, as this is not a
                claim for relief to which any other person is entitled jointly with the defendants.
                Nor is this a situation in which the defendants are not competent to sue alone, such
                as the case of an equitable assignee who was unable to sue for a permanent injunction
                without joining the legal owner as considered in Performing Right Society Ltd v London
                Theatre of Varieties Ltd.
            </p>
            <p id="111">  Insofar as the defendants may recover more than their entitlement out of the 20%
                of the profit that would have been transferred to the 1st defendant by the Fund General
                Manager under the Fund II LPA, the device of holding such profit on trust for Fund
                II would ‘avoid over-recovery by D1 and ... protect the interests of Fund II’ Judgment,
                §198. The judge had found earlier that the plaintiff did owe fiduciary duties to the
                limited partners of Fund II and was in breach of the duties owed to them. 
            </p>
            <p id="112">  I see the judge’s method as a viable alternative.  The following provisions in the
                partnership agreements are of note.  I have mentioned clause 1.6(e) of the Fund II
                LPA and clause 1.6(g) of the SAIF II GP LPA, which empower the general partner of
                the partnership concerned to bring proceedings on behalf of that partnership. Clause
                1.6(a) of the Fund II LPA (the corresponding provision of the SAIF II GP LPA is clause
                1.6(c)) empowers the general partner on behalf of the partnership to acquire, hold,
                manage, own and transfer any assets held by the partnership. Clause 2.1 of the Fund
                II LPA provides that the management, control and operation of the affairs of the partnership
                shall be vested exclusively in the general partner.  Clause 2.1(a) of the SAIF II
                GP LPA provides similarly that the management, control and operation of the partnership,
                its investments and other activities shall be vested exclusively in the general partner.
            </p>
            <p id="113">  In light of these provisions, the 1st and 2nd defendants as the general partner
                of the respective partnerships are empowered to bring proceedings on behalf of Fund
                II, to hold on trust the asset acquired for Fund II being the profit to be disgorged,
                and exclusively to deal with the profit by making distribution to the limited partners
                according to their entitlement under the relevant partnership agreement.  By authorising
                the defendants to bring the counterclaim and hold on trust the profit to be disgorged
                for Fund II, Fund II must be taken to have elected to pursue its remedy against the
                plaintiff by this route, and would be barred from bringing a new claim in its own
                name.  In other words, Fund II would be bound by the outcome of these proceedings,
                and hence the essential purpose had it been joined as a party would similarly be achieved.

            <p id="115">  Notwithstanding there is no direct authority in support of the defendants’ proposition,
                I am satisfied that the method devised by the judge did not fall foul of any principle
                in law and is procedurally feasible.  I reject the plaintiff’s contention that the
                judge had no jurisdiction to grant relief on the counterclaim on the ground that Fund
                II, the Fund II investors and the WOFE were not parties to this action.

            <p><b>D4. Reflective loss</b></p>
            <p id="116">  The plaintiff’s contention is that the judgment on the Xinrui counterclaim was made
                without jurisdiction as this is precluded by the principle barring claims for reflective
                loss.  It was pleaded in §§77 and 78 of the Re-amended Reply and Amended Defence to
                Counterclaim that if the matters complained of caused any loss to the defendants,
                Fund II or the Fund General Partner, such loss is merely reflective of loss suffered
                by entities in which the defendants, Fund II and/or the Fund General Partner have
                a direct or indirect interest and in respect of which such entities may bring their
                own claims against the plaintiff and is therefore not recoverable by the defendants,
                Fund II and/or the Fund General Partner by reason of the principle against recovery
                of reflective loss.

            <p id="117">  This issue of reflective loss, although pleaded in the Re-amended Reply and Amended

                In the plaintiff’s written opening submission, there was a brief mention of reflective
                loss but no discussion at all Plaintiff’s Opening Submission, §2.4(23). In the written
                closing submission, the impression was given that the point of reflective loss was
                abandoned, as §§77 and 78 of the Re-amended Reply and Amended Defence to Counterclaim
                were described as ‘Now Redundant’ Plaintiff’s Closing Submission, §2.5(23). It is
                understandable that the judge did not find it necessary to address any question of
                reflective loss in his judgment.
            </p>
            <p id="118">  Be that as it may, Mr Barlow argued on appeal that the defendants’ claim is barred
                by the principle against reflective loss.  His ‘core contention’ was that ‘the only
                potential claimant was the WOFE’, but the WOFE was not made a party to the action
                and the 1st defendant was not entitled to enforce any reflective rights or entitlements
                of non-parties, whether this be the WOFE or the Fund II investors.  There is no discretion
                involved where the principle barring claims for reflective loss applies as this is
                a matter of principleJohnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co[2002] 2 AC 1 at 62F. It may be applied
                not only where the company had the right to sue but also where it had declined or
                failed to sue Waddington Ltd v Chan Chun Hoo (2008) 11 HKCFAR 370 at §87, and it can
                apply to other types of remedies including an account of profits Pico North Asia Holdings
                Ltd v Cheung Yuk Ting Linda &amp; Anor, HCA 1371/2009, 8 February 2011, §33.
            </p>
            <p id="119">  Mr Barlow further contended that the judge had no jurisdiction to try or determine
                any claim because the defendants, after they had abandoned all their counterclaims
                for damages shortly before the trial, had never pleaded any claim for an account for
                loss of profits on behalf of anyone, including the Fund II investors who were absent.
            </p>
            <p id="120">  The last point may be dealt with shortly, as it is plainly incorrect.  The defendants
                did plead in §61.5 of the Amended Counterclaim that the plaintiff is liable to account
                to them for all benefits which he has received by reason of the breaches of fiduciary
                duties owed to the defendants and Fund II.
            </p>
            <p id="121">  It is for the plaintiff to establish the applicability of the principle on reflective
                loss.  The starting point is that the present case involves layers of different partnerships
                and entities governed by different laws.  At the very least, there are three limited
                partnerships governed under Cayman Islands law (the 1st defendant, the Fund General
                Partner, and Fund II), a Cayman Islands company (My Show) and a PRC company (the WOFE).
                It is incumbent on the plaintiff to (1) specifically identify which entity or entities
                he says would have a reflective claim; and (2) specifically establish a claim available
                to such entity or entities to recover the same loss.  As Peter Gibson LJ said in Shaker
                v Al-Bedrawi [2003] Ch 350 at §83:
            </p>
            <p id="122">  At the hearing below, the plaintiff did not make clear which entity or entities
                he alleged would have a reflective claim.  Even on appeal, whilst Mr Barlow submitted
                that ‘the only potential claimant was the WOFE’ for the purpose of reflective loss,
                he also sought to argue that the defendants’ claims are reflective of the loss of
                the Fund II investors.
            </p>
            <p id="123">  It seems to me there are formidable difficulties in his way.  I agree with Mr Manzoni
                that the plaintiff should not be allowed to raise the point of reflective loss on
                appeal, as this court cannot be satisfied there is no reasonable possibility that
                the state of the evidence bearing upon the contention would have been materially more
                favourable to the other side if the point had been taken at the trial (Flywin Co Ltd
                v Strong &amp; Associates Ltd (2002) 5 HKCFAR 356 at §38; 
                Lehmanbrown Ltd v Union Trade Holdings Inc[2015] HKCU 1343  , HCMP 977/2015, 17 June
                2015, §10).
            </p>
            <p id="124">  As submitted by Mr Manzoni, there are at least three issues that required further
                factual investigation at the trial stage:
            </p>
            <p><b>(1) The applicable law for the reflective loss principle</b></p>
            <p id="125">  The WOFE is a PRC company.  The law of the place of incorporation may or may not
                recognise the reflective loss principle. No expert evidence was adduced in the court
                below on PRC law in this respect.
            </p>
            <p><b>(2) Whether the reflective loss principle is applicable to entities that are not companies</b></p>
            <p id="126">  Fund II is not a company but an exempted limited partnership registered under the
                laws of the Cayman Islands.  Although evidence on Cayman Islands law was adduced below,
                there was no evidence on the applicability of the principle of reflective loss to
                an exempted limited partnership as this issue was not properly raised.  In a similar
                situation concerning a Jersey family trust, the Court of Appeal declined to permit
                the defendants to argue on appeal for the first time the reflective loss principle
                as even under English trust law, the application of this principle in relation to
                trusts is unclear on the authorities, and is fact-specific (Zhang Hong Li &amp; Ors v
                DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd &amp; Ors [2018] HKCA 435 at §§27 and 28).
            </p>
            <p><b>(3) Whether the WOFE has a claim and the relief applicable</b></p>
            <p id="127">  Insofar as the plaintiff has now raised that the losses are reflective of the WOFE’s
                losses, the plaintiff had not attempted to specify what cause of action the WOFE would
                have against him, and what relief would be available.  These may well be matters of
                PRC law and it is for the plaintiff to establish that the claim of the WOFE is available
                on the facts.  Quite apart from the fact that the judge did not find that fiduciary
                duties were owed by the plaintiff to the WOFE (contrary to Mr Barlow’s contention),
                no evidence on PRC law was adduced below on all these pertinent matters.
            </p>
            <p id="128">  It would be clearly unfair to allow the plaintiff to raise reflective loss on appeal.
                It is simply too late for the plaintiff to run this point.
            </p>
            <p><b>D5. Order for accounts</b></p>
            <p id="129">  Mr Barlow submitted that the judge had become functus officio when he made the order
                in the Accounts Ruling on 26 June 2018, after the order for the judgment of 14 February
                2018 was drawn up and sealed on 21 March 2018.  As a result, the judge had no jurisdiction
                to vary or enlarge the order for the judgment.
            </p>
            <p id="130">  This is a bad point. By the order for the judgment, the plaintiff was required to
                ‘account to the 1st defendant for any profit that the Plaintiff made as a result of
                the investment made by [KPCB] under the [Xinrui Investment Agreement] dated 24 August
                2007’.  It was provided that ‘all necessary enquiries and accounts be taken to identify
                and establish such profits made by the Plaintiff.  For that purpose, the 1st defendant
                shall have liberty to seek directions for taking of such accounts.’  The judge had
                thereby reserved the issue of detailed directions that may be given for the taking
                of the accounts.  Pursuant to the order for the judgment, on 12 March 2018 the defendants
                made an application to seek directions for the taking of the accounts.  The doctrine
                of functus officio plainly has no application to this situation.
            </p>
            <p id="131">  A number of objections were taken in respect of this part of the order in the Accounts
                Ruling by which the plaintiff was required to provide an account of ‘all income, including
                salary, fees, dividends and other remuneration whether by way of ‘Capital Distribution’
                and/or ‘Carried Interest’ or similar payments received by P and/or entities owned
                and/or controlled by P down to 31 December 2012 (‘the end date’) from (i) [KPCB] and
                its subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities ...; and (2) [KV] and its subsidiaries,
                affiliates and related entities...’.
            </p>
            <p id="132">  The plaintiff contended that the order complained of exceeded the permissible bounds
                for an order to account.  He stressed that his obligation is ‘to account for profits
                which have been made in breach of fiduciary duty, not simply to account for profits
                in the abstract.’ (Snell’s Equity (33rd Ed), §7-055)  He should not be made to account
                for more than he actually received as a result of his breach.  One of the matters
                required of him was to account for ‘all income, including salary’. Other money he
                earned such as the salary he agreed with KPCB before they made the Xinrui investment
                was not within the scope of the judgment order, as this was not profit he derived
                from KPCB’s investment made under the Xinrui Investment Agreement.
            </p>
            <p id="133">  He also complained that the order impinged upon his rights, the rights of KPCB and
                the rights of subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities of KPCB and KV, requiring
                them to disclose to the defendants (who are trade competitors) wide-ranging commercially
                sensitive information that was outwith the judgment and the Xinrui counterclaim. Furthermore,
                other than the plaintiff, the other entities had not been given any opportunity to
                be heard.
            </p>
            <p id="134">  I reject all the above contentions.  Similar submissions had been made before the
                judge Accounts Ruling, §6.
            </p>
            <p id="135">  The plaintiff was not asked to account for profits in the abstract.  He was ordered
                to account for any profit he made as a result of the investment made by KPCB under
                the Xinrui Investment Agreement. The Accounts Ruling made clear that given the plaintiff’s
                untruthful account of when he began to discuss a possible investment in Xinrui and
                the relative scarcity of the discovery he provided for the trial, it is appropriate
                to make ‘an order that goes wider than might have been conventionally appropriate
                in setting the modalities for an account of secret profits to be given by a fiduciary’
                Accounts Ruling, §9. It is with such considerations in mind that the order was made,
                so that the court can properly ascertain whether and to what extent those monies could
                be regarded as falling within the scope of his duty to account and disgorge, instead
                of merely relying on the assertion made in his affirmation of 25 March 2018.
            </p>
            <p id="136">  As for monies received including ‘salary, fees, dividends and other remuneration’,
                assuming that his salary was agreed with KPCB before they made the Xinrui investment,
                if his salary was enhanced as a result of the profits he brought in by such investment,
                this may well be a profit attributable to his breach of fiduciary duty for which he
                would come under a duty to account.
            </p>
            <p id="137">  The judge was mindful of the issue of confidentiality raised by the plaintiff and
                addressed this by imposing an undertaking on both defendants that any further information
                provided by the plaintiff pursuant to the order to account will be kept confidential
                save for its use in these proceedings, which use shall be the sole use to which the
                information will be put Accounts Ruling, §8. There is nothing in the point about the
                impingement of third party confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p><b>D6. The ‘abuse’ case</b></p>
            <p id="138">  The plaintiff alleged at the trial that the defences raised by the defendants were
                used to stave off the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment and the counterclaims
                were advanced disingenuously in abuse of the process of the court.  Mr Barlow complained
                that the judge had failed to address these contentions in his judgment.
            </p>
            <p id="139">  This complaint has no merit and may be dealt with succinctly.</p>
            <p id="140">  Mr Manzoni referred us to the observations made by the judge during the oral closing
                submissions of Mr Barlow, in which the judge stated that despite the ‘pejorative averment,
                in very colourful language, as to the lack of substance of good faith in the defence’,
                Mr Barlow ‘did not make it the least bit clear that [he was] advancing a cause of
                action for which [he was] seeking a remedy’ and the plaintiff could not make a claim
                for damages for the abuse of process of the court without an amendment Transcript,
                Day 11, p 126 line 21 to p 127 line 10, p 128 line 14 to p 129 line 11. There was
                no application to amend the writ and the statement of claim.  The judge is wholly
                justified in ignoring the ‘abuse’ case.
            </p>
            <p id="141">  Furthermore, the judge had indicated that he did not find the defendants’ case was
                abusive when he refused to order indemnity costs against the defendants in the Costs
                Ruling.  He rejected the suggestion that the defendants had ‘knowingly manufactured
                a set of false, spurious allegations of misconduct’ against the plaintiff and he could
                see ‘no proper basis for concluding that their counterclaim was anything other than
                a genuine claim’ Costs Ruling, §16. There is no basis to interfere with the judge’s
                findings of fact.
            </p>
            <p><b>D7. Appeal against costs order</b></p>
            <p id="142">  The plaintiff contended that the costs order was ‘perverse and incorrect’ in these
                respects: the judge declined to order costs against the 2nd defendant when the 2nd
                defendant had failed on all of its counterclaims; and he was wrong to order the plaintiff
                to pay 65% of the costs of the defendants in respect of their account of profits counterclaim
                when the 1st defendant had failed on four out of the five heads of counterclaim.
            </p>
            <p id="143">  The judge gave detailed reasons in the Costs Ruling for rejecting the above contentions
                Costs Ruling, §§8(1), 29; §§18 to 28. I have considered his reasons and find no basis
                at all to interfere with his exercise of discretion.
            </p>
            <p><b>D8. Conclusion in the plaintiff’s appeal</b></p>
            <p id="144">  There is no merit in any of the grounds of appeal advanced by the plaintiff.  I
                would dismiss his appeal with an order nisi that he should pay the defendants’ costs
                of this appeal, with a certificate for two counsel.
            </p>
            <p><b>E. THE DEFENDANTS’ CROSS-APPEAL</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>E1. The issues in the defendants’ cross-appeal</b></p>
            <p id="145">  As mentioned at the outset of this judgment, the three main issues raised by the
                defendants in their cross-appeal to challenge the judgment on the plaintiff’s claim
                are as follows:
            </p>
            <p><b>(1) The proviso (iv) point</b></p>
            <p id="146">  Whether on the proper construction of proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c) of the ALPA,
                this provision was triggered when the plaintiff’s status as a limited partner was
                terminated so as to reduce his entitlement to Carried Interest by 95%.
            </p>
            <p><b>(2) The clause 8 point</b></p>
            <p id="147">  Whether on the proper construction of clause 8 of the SA the defendants are debarred
                from advancing their claim that the plaintiff’s applicable percentage is that set
                out in proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c) of the ALPA and that his applicable percentage
                is locked at 51.78%.
            </p>
            <p><b>(3) The misrepresentation point</b></p>
            <p id="148">  Whether the plaintiff was obliged to disclose his breaches of duty to the defendants
                prior to entering into the SA or upon commencement of his breaches and by not so disclosing
                was guilty of an implied misrepresentation that there was no wrongdoing to disclose
                such that the defendants are entitled to rescind the SA, alternatively to recover
                damages against the plaintiff the effect of which is to cancel out the plaintiff’s
                claim.
            </p>
            <p><b>E2. The proviso (iv) point</b></p>
            <p id="149">  I have earlier summarised the effect of proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c) of the ALPA.
                I now set out the provisions in full in article 7.1(a) to (c):
            </p>
            <p id="150">  The expression ‘Termination with Cause’ in proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c) is not
                defined in the definitions provision in article 11, nor does this expression appear
                anywhere else in the ALPA.  In the further proviso to article 7.1(c), the expression
                ‘terminated for Cause’ appeared twice.
            </p>
            <p id="151">  The only expressions relating to the termination of a limited partner that have
                been defined in article 11 are ‘Termination for Cause’ and ‘Termination without Cause’
                and they read as follows:
            </p>
            <p id="152">  The defendants contended that albeit the plaintiff’s termination as a limited partner
                as a result of the SA was a consensual arrangement and not an ‘involuntary termination’
                at the time, if, following the consensual termination it was discovered that the plaintiff
                had been guilty of conduct amounting to ‘Cause’, his employment would have been terminated
                ‘with Cause’ within proviso (iv).  In other words, the word ‘with’ does not connote
                a causal connection between the termination and ‘Cause’.  So if a limited partner’s
                conduct fell within ‘Cause’, it would not matter that the Cause was discovered after
                the termination and was not causally linked to it.
            </p>
            <p id="153">  The judge rejected this contention. He held that it is clear the word ‘with’ in
                proviso (iv) was used interchangeably with the word ‘for’ and the definition of ‘Termination
                for Cause’ in article 11 must be taken to be the applicable definition for ‘Termination
                with Cause’ in proviso (iv). The word ‘for’ plainly signifies a causal connection
                between the termination and the Cause so that the termination must at the time it
                occurs be by reason of conduct amounting to ‘Cause’.  And the termination of the plaintiff’s
                employment is not covered by the definition of ‘Termination for Cause’ because that
                termination was not involuntary but voluntary in the nature of an agreed termination
                as provided for in the SA Judgment, §§73 to 74.
            </p>
            <p id="154">  Mr Manzoni argued that the judge was wrong to assume that the definition of ‘Termination
                for Cause’ in article 11 is the applicable definition for ‘Termination with Cause’
                in proviso (iv).  He submitted there is no basis to ignore the difference in wording.
                Whereas ‘Termination for Cause’ is defined to mean an involuntary termination, ‘Termination
                with Cause’ has not been defined in the ALPA so it may not be involuntary.  The word
                ‘with’ (as opposed to ‘for’) in ordinary English language does not import a sense
                of causation.  Instead, the word ‘with’ requires the co-existence of two elements,
                ‘termination’ and ‘Cause’.  This interpretation is more consistent with the clear
                commercial purpose behind proviso (iv), which is to prevent a wrongdoing limited partner
                from reaping the full benefit of his otherwise entitlement.  To interpret proviso
                (iv) as being limited to ‘Termination for Cause’ would lead to the absurd result that
                whether this provision will achieve its objective is wholly dependent on the vagaries
                of whether the partnership can discover the existence of Cause and on that basis terminate
                the wrongdoing limited partner, or whether the partner succeeds in hiding his wrongdoing
                for sufficient time for him to resign first.  An interpretation which flouts common
                sense should be disfavoured.  And the provision should be interpreted so far as possible
                in such a manner as not to allow a wrongdoer to take advantage of his own wrong (Lewison
                on The Interpretation of Contracts (6th Ed) §7.10).
            </p>
            <p id="155">  I agree with the judge there is no ambiguity about proviso (iv) and it is clear
                that the word ‘with’ was used interchangeably with ‘for’ in article 7.1(c) so that
                the definition of ‘Termination for Cause’ in article 11 must be taken to be the applicable
                definition for ‘Termination with Cause’ in this proviso. 
            </p>
            <p id="156">  The expression ‘Termination with Cause’ is not defined in article 11.  As mentioned
                earlier, the only expressions defined in article 11 relating to the termination of
                a limited partner are ‘Termination for Cause’ and ‘Termination without Cause’.  If
                ‘Termination with Cause’ is intended to have a meaning different from that of ‘Termination
                for Cause’ and is another kind of situation relating to the termination of a limited
                partner, there is no good reason why this third situation should not be defined in
                article 11.
            </p>
            <p id="157">  Other than in proviso (iv), the expression ‘Termination with Cause’ does not appear
                anywhere else in the ALPA.  ‘Termination without Cause’ is mentioned in proviso (iii).
                If ‘Termination with Cause’ in proviso (iv) is not construed as equivalent to ‘Termination
                for Cause’, it is difficult to see why there should be a definition of ‘Termination
                for Cause’ in article 11, as the expression ‘Termination for Cause’ does not appear
                in any other part of the ALPA.
            </p>
            <p id="158">  In the further proviso to article 7.1(c), the phrase ‘terminated for Cause’ appeared
                twice.  This reinforces the view that the expression ‘Termination with Cause’ in the
                earlier proviso being proviso (iv) is meant to be read consistently as ‘Termination
                for Cause’, as otherwise there would be no mention of ‘Termination for Cause’ in article
                7.1(c) and no need for making the further proviso. 
            </p>
            <p id="159">  Mr Barlow also made a valid point that the key words in proviso (iv) read: ‘if a
                Limited Partner becomes an Inactive Partner due to Termination with Cause’.  The defendants’
                interpretation that no causal connection between the termination and ‘Cause’ is required
                does not agree with the natural meaning of the key words.
            </p>
            <p id="160">  The judge has further considered proviso (iv) on the assumption there were an ambiguity
                and he construed this provision strictly in favour of the plaintiff applying the contra
                proferentem rule.  Mr Manzoni argued that the judge was wrong to assume a contra proferentem
                construction against the defendants.  I do not think there is any need to apply this
                rule of construction as I am satisfied there is no ambiguity in the meaning of proviso
                (iv).
            </p>
            <p id="161">  Nor do I agree with Mr Manzoni that the clear commercial purpose of proviso (iv)
                must be to prevent a wrongdoing limited partner from reaping the full benefit of his
                otherwise entitlement.  That seems to be looking at the matter back to front.  As
                Lord Neuberger stated in Arnold v Britton[2015] AC 1619 at §19: ‘... commercial common
                sense is not to be invoked retrospectively.  The mere fact that a contractual arrangement,
                if interpreted according to its natural language, has worked out badly, or even disastrously,
                for one of the parties is not a reason for departing from the natural language.’ 
                Lord Neuberger further emphasised at §20: ‘... while commercial common sense is a
                very important factor to take into account when interpreting a contract, a court should
                be very slow to reject the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply because
                it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed, even
                ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight.’  This point was also made by the judge
                when he rejected the defendants’ construction in §81 of the judgment. 
            </p>
            <p id="162">  The defendants’ case of relying on proviso (iv) to reduce the plaintiff’s entitlement
                to Carried Interest by 95% fails in limine, as they are unable to bring themselves
                within this proviso.
            </p>
            <p><b>E3. The clause 8 point</b></p>
            <p id="163">  The plaintiff adopted a belt and braces approach in relying on clause 8 of the SA
                to contend that there should be no reduction of his entitlement. I will set out this
                provision again for convenience:
            </p>
            <p id="164">  The judge held in favour of the plaintiff on the construction of this provision
                in one short paragraph at §62.  He held that the natural and ordinary meaning of this
                provision is that once the additional nine months of vesting has vested (giving a
                final vested percentage of 51.78%), that final percentage is forever after fixed and
                cannot be reduced.
            </p>
            <p id="165">  In view of my conclusion on the proviso (iv) point, it is not strictly necessary
                to consider clause 8.  In deference to counsel’s submissions, I will deal with this
                succinctly.
            </p>
            <p id="166">  Mr Manzoni argued along the same lines of the plaintiff’s trial counsel in that
                the last sentence in clause 8 simply means that if breaches of the SA are discovered
                within the additional nine-month period of vesting, the defendants are entitled to
                cease any further additional vesting but those parts of the already vested additional
                vesting will not be affected.  Clause 8 concerns only the additional vesting, it is
                not free-standing and does not have the more general effect as interpreted by the
                judge of precluding the operation of proviso (iv) in reducing the plaintiff’s percentage
                entitlement under the ALPA.
            </p>
            <p id="167">  I am inclined to agree with the judge on the natural and ordinary meaning of the
                last sentence of clause 8.  Furthermore, the judge has held that the meaning of the
                last sentence of clause 7 (‘The provisions in this memo supersede any previous agreements
                entered into between Joe and SAIF.’) is that the amendments made by the SA to the
                ALPA as it applies to the plaintiff supersede those original ALPA provisions from
                the date of the SA.  Reading clause 8 with clause 7, it is clear that article 7.1(c)
                of the ALPA has been superseded by the amendments made to it by clause 8 of the SA,
                including the proviso (iv) to article 7.1(c), bearing in mind that the plaintiff departed
                on mutually agreed terms in the SA and not by involuntary termination.  The effect
                of this is that proviso (iv) has been superseded by clause 8 from the date of the
                SA, and the last sentence of clause 8 makes clear ‘there shall be no recourse or reduction
                once the carry interest is vested’.
            </p>
            <p><b>E4. The misrepresentation point</b></p>
            <p id="168">  This was advanced as a fall-back argument if the plaintiff should fail on the two
                earlier points on construction.
            </p>
            <p><b>E4.1 The proper scope of the argument on the misrepresentation point</b></p>
            <p id="169">  Mr Manzoni sought to argue on appeal that the plaintiff was under an obligation
                to disclose his breaches of duty prior to entering into the SA on 11 December 2006
                or upon commencement of his breaches, some of which could be after the SA was entered
                into.  The plaintiff’s failure to disclose his breaches amounted to an implied representation
                that there was no wrongdoing to disclose and was false, as there were wrongdoings
                on the part of the plaintiff and his subordinates.  Had the defendants known of the
                wrongdoings, they would not have entered into the SA.  The defendants are therefore
                entitled to rescind the SA, alternatively to recover damages which would extinguish
                the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety.
            </p>
            <p id="170">  He further argued that even if the plaintiff was actively involved in serious discussions
                with Zhou Yang about investing in an entity to develop the Diandao technology only
                around late January 2007 (as the judge had found) and not prior to 11 December 2006,
                the defendants are still entitled to damages for misrepresentation which will cancel
                out a part of the plaintiff’s additional entitlement under clause 8 of the SA Ground
                6 of the Respondent’s Notice.  This is because the additional entitlement is conditional,
                as clause 8 provides: ‘The non-vested portion of the additional nine months vesting
                shall continue to be vested as long as Joe has compliant [sic] with the provisions
                and obligations under the [sic] this separation agreements [sic].’ As the plaintiff
                had breached the positive duty to disclose his and his subordinates’ wrongdoings,
                he impliedly represented he had no relevant wrongdoing to disclose, which was false.
                In reliance on this misrepresentation, the defendants did not exercise their right
                to stop the vesting of the additional entitlement.  They therefore suffered losses
                to the extent of any additional vesting that should have ceased and such losses will
                cancel out part of the plaintiff’s claim.
            </p>
            <p id="171">  It is important to see how the claim for misrepresentation was pleaded in the Re-amended
                Defence and Counterclaim.  I quote the relevant paragraphs:
            </p>
            <p id="172">  Quite clearly, the argument sought to be run on appeal that the plaintiff should
                be deprived of part of the additional entitlement on the basis of implied misrepresentation
                there was no relevant wrongdoing to disclose so that the defendants did not exercise
                their right to cease vesting the additional entitlement had not been pleaded.  One
                can also see from the exchanges with the judge during the oral closing submissions
                of the defendants’ trial counsel that for the purpose of the claim in misrepresentation,
                the defendants’ case was confined to the plaintiff’s failure to disclose breaches
                that occurred before the SA was made Transcript, Day 11 p 65 lines 6 to 15; p 70 line
                22 to p 71 line 18. On the principles of Flywin Co Ltd v Strong &amp; Associates Ltd and
                Lehmanbrown Ltd v Union Trade Holdings Inc &amp; Ors, the defendants cannot be permitted
                to raise this unpleaded point on appeal. 
            </p>
            <p id="173">  So for the purpose of the misrepresentation point, as regards wrongdoings that the
                plaintiff was alleged to be under a duty to disclose, such wrongdoings must be confined
                to those that occurred before the SA was made on 11 December 2006.  With the scope
                of the arguments confined in this manner, the only wrongdoings relied on by the defendants
                as mentioned in Mr Manzoni’s submissions are (1) the plaintiff’s failure to ensure
                effective financial control over the US$2.5 million loan made on 15 September 2006;
                and (2) the plaintiff’s deleted reference to the phrase ‘planning new generation of
                targeted online advertising’ from the power point slides prepared for an advisory
                board meeting of the 1st defendant which took place around 19 November 2006.
            </p>
            <p id="174">  Before I turn to the arguments relating to the US$2.5 million loan and the amendment
                of the power point slides, I will deal with the submissions made regarding the basis
                and scope of the duty to disclose said to be imposed on the plaintiff.  
            </p>
            <p><b>E4.2 The basis and scope of the duty to disclose</b></p>
            <p id="175">  In the pleading Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim, §63 and the arguments made
                at the trial Judgment, §59(III) &amp; (IV); Transcript, Day 11 p 69 line 4 and line 20
                to p 71 line 6 (first basis) and p 65 lines 4 to 5, p 67 lines 5 to 7, p 68 line 19
                to p 69 line 10 (second basis), the duty to disclose was put on two bases: general
                release and fiduciary relationship. 
            </p>
            <p id="176">  The first basis is premised on the SA being a general release by the defendants
                of any claim they may have had against the plaintiff founded on ‘Cause’, relying on
                Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali &amp; Ors [2002] 1 AC 251, in particular
                §§32 and 69, which read as follows:
            </p>
            <p id="177">  The first basis was rejected by the judge for these reasons Judgment, §67. The SA
                was not a general release but an agreement governing a range of matters arising out
                of the plaintiff’s departure from SAIF Partners, of which his applicable percentage
                was just one of the matters agreed upon. Moreover, the SA did not release the plaintiff
                from all claims arising out of the misconduct relied on by the defendants, as is evidenced
                by the counterclaim for damages brought by the defendants for losses alleged to have
                been suffered by reason of such misconduct.  The judge was also far from satisfied
                that the plaintiff knew that either of the defendants had a claim against him to reduce
                his applicable percentage under article 7 of the ALPA and was not prepared to infer
                that he had such knowledge as no suggestion of knowledge was made in his cross-examination.
            </p>
            <p id="178">  The judge must be right in rejecting the first basis. Mr Manzoni criticized the
                judge as taking an ‘unduly narrow’ approach and that it is wrong in principle to require
                disclosure of only those wrongdoings constituting or relevant to ‘Cause’.  I do not
                think his criticism is justified.  The judge was addressing the first basis which
                is premised on there being a general release from any claim the defendants may have
                had against the plaintiff founded on ‘Cause’.  Looked at in this context, the pertinent
                question to ask must be whether the plaintiff had knowledge that the defendants had
                a claim to reduce his applicable percentage.  Whether the duty to disclose should
                cover all wrongdoings and not just those relevant to ‘Cause’ if the duty is founded
                on a different basis is another consideration.
            </p>
            <p id="179">  The second basis for the duty to disclose is founded on the duty owed by the plaintiff
                to the defendants as a fiduciary.  The judge did not deal with this in his judgment.
                Having been referred by the defendants’ trial counsel to Conlon &amp; Anr v Simms [2008]
                1 WLR 484 at §130, he expressed the view in his exchanges with counsel that the fiduciary
                would have a duty to disclose only where there is fraud Transcript, Day 11 p 67 line
                7, p 68 line 19 to p 69 line 10, and there is no fraudulent breach of duty as regards
                the plaintiff.
            </p>
            <p id="180">  Mr Manzoni referred us to the judgment of Arden LJ (with whom Mummery LJ and Holman
                J agreed) in Item Software (UK) Ltd v Fassihi &amp; Ors [2005] 2 BCLC 91, which was not
                cited in the court below. Arden LJ rejected the submission that the duty of a director
                (who is subject to fiduciary duties) to disclose his own misconduct is limited to
                fraudulent misconduct (§§21, 26 and 44). This is how the duty to disclose was expounded
                in §41:
            </p>
            <p id="181">  Arden LJ acknowledged in §44 that the only reason it could be said that the duty
                of loyalty does not require a fiduciary to disclose his own misconduct is that ‘it
                has never been applied to this situation before’, but did not regard this a good objection
                to the application of the fiduciary principle.
            </p>
            <p id="182">  Of the cases that considered Item Software, these two decisions are of note: Brandeaux
                Advisers (UK) Ltd &amp; Ors v Chadwick [2010] EWHC 3241 (QB), Jack J; and GHLM Trading
                Ltd v Maroo &amp; Ors [2012] EWHC 61 (Ch), Newey J.
            </p>
            <p id="183">  In Brandeaux Advisers, Jack J pointed out at §47 that Item Software has not been
                ‘without its critics’, and mentioned as an example Palmer’s Company Law which referred
                to its finding as ‘controversial’.  In GHLM Trading at §193, Newey J remarked that
                Item Software arguably breaks new ground in treating a fiduciary duty as ‘prescriptive
                rather than merely proscriptive’ and suggested that its result can be justified also
                by subsequent legislation being section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.

            <p id="184">  On the basis that a director’s duty of good faith under section 172 can potentially
                require him to disclose misconduct, Newey J went on to make the points (at §§194 and
                195) that the duty of good faith focuses on a fiduciary’s subjective intentions and
                it can be incumbent on a fiduciary to disclose matters other than wrongdoing as the
                ‘single and overriding touchstone’ is the duty of a director to act in what he considers
                in good faith to be in the best interests of the company and there is no reason to
                restrict the disclosure that can be necessary to misconduct.  ‘Were a director subjectively
                to consider that it was in the company’s interests for something other than misconduct
                to be disclosed, he would, it appears, commit a breach of his duty of good faith if
                he failed to do so.’
            </p>
            <p id="185">  Mr Manzoni placed particular reliance on the above dicta of Newey J.  He submitted
                that the scope of the duty to disclose is broad and extends to knowledge of ‘potential
                or preliminary wrongdoing’ as these would be matters that would be in the interests
                of the company (or the partnership in this instance) to be disclosed.  He contended
                that the judge was wrong in drawing a distinction between the plaintiff merely ‘entertaining
                the possibility’ of investing in a company which Zhou Yang intended should take forward
                the Diandao technology, and the plaintiff having a ‘settled intention’ to join in
                Zhou Yang’s plans for Xinrui Judgment, §67, as the scope of the duty to disclose is
                not so restricted and it is not necessary to establish that the plaintiff had ‘crossed
                the Rubicon’ to found liability.
            </p>
            <p id="186">  This line of argument was not mentioned in the defendants’ pleading or raised at
                the trial and it would not be fair to allow this to be run for the first time on appeal
                in contravention of the Flywin principle.  I do not propose to deal with it.  The
                defendants should be confined to their case advanced at the trial that the duty to
                disclose relates to the acts of misconduct complained of in their pleading, being
                the breaches of fiduciary duty and the wrongdoings constituting ‘Cause’. 
            </p>
            <p id="187">  I will assume for the time in the defendants’ favour that it is incumbent on a fiduciary
                to disclose his own misconduct.  If the two instances of misconduct relied on to found
                the claim in misrepresentation cannot be established on the facts (as the judge had
                found), it is not necessary to decide on the scope of the duty imposed on a fiduciary
                to disclose his own misconduct.
            </p>
            <p id="189">  That leaves the holding that no ‘Cause’ was established as regards the plaintiff’s
                involvement in the making of this loan.
            </p>
            <p id="190">  The judge held that the plaintiff took insufficient account of Mr Yan’s insistence
                that effective financial controls be imposed on the WOFE and he thereby exposed My
                Show and Fund II to an unnecessary risk that the proceeds of the loan would not be
                spent properly in furtherance of the WOFE’s business.  He also found that the plaintiff
                failed to honour his assurance that he would devote sufficient time to the supervision
                of the My Show investment Judgment, §150. Nevertheless, ‘Cause’ was not established
                because the judge held against the defendants’ interpretation of ‘Cause’ in article
                11.1 and the covenants in article 3.2 of the ALPA.
            </p>
            <p id="191">  ‘Cause’ was defined in article 11.1 to mean a failure by the Limited Partner ‘to
                comply in a material respect with or a material breach ... of any ... policy’ of the
                defendants, or a failure by the Limited Partner ‘to comply with or breach by such
                Limited Partner of any provision of Section 3.2’.
            </p>
            <p id="192">  In respect of the failure to comply with or breach of ‘policy’, the judge held that
                ‘policy’ in the definition of ‘Cause’ connotes a statement calling itself a ‘policy’
                issued by the General Partner, the Partnership, the Fund General Partner, the Fund
                Manager or any of their affiliates Judgment, §91. There are examples of a statement
                of this nature being the Policy Against Trading on the Basis of Inside Information,
                the Policy Against Trading Stock of Restricted Companies, and the Policy of Confidentiality
                which the plaintiff covenanted in his contract with SAIF BJ to sign and comply with
                Judgment, §86.  No such statement calling itself a policy was issued as regards the
                tight financial control to be maintained over the portfolio companies.  The defendants
                only relied on various emails issued by Mr Yan in February 2006 before the My Show
                SPA was made Judgment, §§17 to 18, 21. The judge reasoned that a partner should have
                little difficulty in identifying what ‘policy’ was caught by the definition of ‘Cause’.
                If this was not contained in a statement calling itself a ‘policy’ issued by an appropriate
                body, the limited partner could well be uncertain as to what was within or without
                the reach of ‘policy’ in the definition of ‘Cause’ Judgment, §90.
            </p>
            <p id="193">  Mr Manzoni submitted that the judge had in effect relied upon the contra proferentem
                principle, which ought not to apply as there is no factual basis to support the judge’s
                assumption that the ALPA was proffered to the plaintiff on a ‘take it or leave it
                basis’ Judgment, §§78 and 87. He contended that it is contrary to commercial sense
                to restrict the meaning of ‘policy’ to require a formal written document, as it would
                be inconsistent with the flexible and rapid decision-making necessary in the investment
                funds context. The judge should have found that the emails issued by Mr Yan amounted
                to ‘policy’ within the definition of ‘Cause’.
            </p>
            <p id="194">  Quite apart from the contra proferentem rule which the judge applied, he had construed
                the meaning of ‘policy’ in the definition of ‘Cause’ with regard to the overall purpose
                of the provision in article 7.1 in which ‘Cause’ appears, namely that it is part of
                a set of provisions under which a limited partner’s points allocation can be forfeited
                Judgment, §87.  Given the context of the relevant provisions, I think he is right
                to adopt a restrictive meaning for the word ‘policy’.
            </p>
            <p id="195">  As for the failure to comply with any of the covenants in article 3.2 as amounting
                to ‘Cause’, the covenant relied on by the defendants for this purpose is the second
                sentence in article 3.2(d), which provides that each limited partner shall not conduct
                himself ‘in a manner adversely affecting the Partnership, the General Partner, the
                Fund Manager, the Fund, the Fund General Partner, the Partners, the limited partners
                of the Fund or any Portfolio Company or any of their respective Affiliates’. The defendants
                contended that the ambit of this sentence is wide enough to cover the plaintiff’s
                conduct in failing to ensure effective financial controls over the US$2.5 million
                loan.  The plaintiff was therefore in breach of the covenant in article 3.2(d) and
                this constituted ‘Cause’ as defined.
            </p>
            <p id="196">  The judge rejected the defendants’ construction. He held that read in the context
                of article 3.2(d) as a whole, the conduct prohibited by the second sentence is conduct
                that is injurious to the reputation of the adumbrated entities and not conduct that
                causes them direct financial loss or direct operational difficulties.  In other words,
                this sentence is equivalent to an obligation not to bring the listed entities into
                disrepute by, for example, publicly ‘bad mouthing’ them, or by expressing offensive
                and/or highly controversial views, or by disreputable personal behaviour that comes
                into the public domain and thereby reflects badly on the listed entities.  This wording
                does not apply to the plaintiff’s involvement in the US$2.5 million loan. Judgment,
                §94
            </p>
            <p id="197">  Mr Manzoni submitted that the judge was in error in adopting such a restrictive
                interpretation and the judge would appear to have taken into account that the heading
                of article 3.2(d) is ‘Non-Disparagement’. Under article 12.4, it is provided that
                the headings of articles are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall
                not be deemed to constitute a part or affect the interpretation.
            </p>
            <p id="198">  I do not think counsel’s criticism is justified. As mentioned, the judge had construed
                article 3.2(d) as a whole.  The first sentence relates to the disclosure of information
                that ‘reflects negatively upon or otherwise disparages’ the listed entities.  The
                second sentence relates to ‘conduct ... in a manner adversely affecting’ the listed
                entities.  Read in the context of the first sentence, the conduct prohibited in the
                second sentence should be conduct injurious to the reputation of the listed entities.
                The judge is clearly right in his interpretation of this provision.
            </p>
            <p id="199">  I uphold the judge’s finding that no ‘Cause’ was established as regards the plaintiff’s
                involvement in the making of the US$2.5 million loan.  The first of the two instances
                of misconduct relied on to found the claim in misrepresentation cannot be established
                on the facts.
            </p>
            <p><b>E4.4 The amendment of the power point slides</b></p>
            <p id="200">  The plaintiff deleted the reference to the phrase ‘planning the new generation of
                targeted online advertising’ from the power point slides prepared by Mr Zhao for an
                advisory board meeting of the 1st defendant around 19 November 2006.  The defendants
                alleged that this was done for the purpose of concealing his involvement in Zhou Yang’s
                scheme of competing with the WOFE through developing the Diandao technology of Ding
                Jun.
            </p>
            <p id="201">  The judge was not satisfied that by 19 November 2006, the plaintiff was resolved
                on seeking to invest on his account in an entity separate from the WOFE that would
                develop Ding Jun’s technology. Instead, he found that from a date that preceded 6
                February 2007 by at least a few days, the plaintiff was in serious discussion with
                Zhou Yang about investing in a venture independent from the WOFE in which Zhou Yang
                would have interest, the business of that venture being to utilise Ding Jun’s technology.
                It was ‘after a deal of anxious consideration’ that the judge found the plaintiff
                did not amend the slides to conceal a scheme in which he would invest in an entity
                competing with the WOFE Judgment, §§170, 171.
            </p>
            <p id="202">  The defendants sought to challenge this finding of fact.  It was submitted that
                although the judge had recorded the plaintiff’s explanation for the deletion Judgment,
                §161, he failed to consider the veracity of that explanation and failed to take into
                account all relevant considerations.  The judge had already ruled that the plaintiff
                had put up a false case that he only knew about the Diandao or Point Advertising technology
                in April 2007, and only decided to seriously discuss investment in May or June 2007
                Judgment, §§114, 170. The plaintiff’s explanation should not be believed in light
                of the evidence given by the defendants’ witnesses, Mr Zhao and Li Meng, whom the
                judge found to be truthful and credible.
            </p>
            <p id="203">  I do not consider there is any proper basis to interfere with the judge’s finding
                of fact.  The judge had declined to infer that the amendments to the slides were made
                for the purpose as alleged by the defendants after a thorough review of the evidence.
                The question of weight is a matter for the trial judge.  It cannot be said that he
                was plainly wrong in so finding.  The defendants have failed to establish the only
                other instance of misconduct relied on to found misrepresentation. 
            </p>
            <p><b>E5. Conclusion in the defendants’ cross-appeal</b></p>
            <p id="204">  For the reasons given above, the defendants fail on all the grounds of appeal. 
                Their cross-appeal must be dismissed.  I would make an order nisi that the defendants
                are to pay the plaintiff’s costs in the defendants’ cross-appeal, with a certificate
                for two counsel.
